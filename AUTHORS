Disappeared contributors, who either we don't have an email address for, or who don't
respond to email, or who haven't responded to my request for either permission to or

Note that up until 2006, Freenet included the COPYING file and most source files did 
not include a GPL notice; a few files actually specified just version 2. A decision was
made to relicense to "GPL 2 or later" if possible and add headers to that effect to all
files.
