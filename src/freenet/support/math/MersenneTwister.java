/*
** Originally, we maintained the below functionality as a fork of the above
** code, in the contrib repo. Eventually this was refactored into this class,
** and now we instead depend on upstream mantissa.
**
** There are three milestone commits:
**
** O: 35a37bfad5b42dead835c9f1fb8b0972e730dab2, the earliest version we have in git, imported from svn
** A: 5d16406e4a20c9e6bd9685bf9a8480a13c8acbaf, the latest version we made edits to
** X: aea5c9d491b8de90b3457c0561938ea2ed14ec1d, representing a pristine 7.2 source
**
** You may view the diffs using something like:
**
**  $ git diff -w [S] [T] -- java{,-test}/org/spaceroots/mantissa/random/
**
** As of fred commit e89a2f63e819e8c088a14eaa3c809770db822956, this class, and
** its associated test, re-implements the diff between X-A, by extending
** o.s.m.r.MersenneTwister. Above that, it is also runtime-compatible with any
** version (O,A,X) of it.
**
** This should provide a smooth upgrade path:
**
** # Move users to this class, still running contrib-26 at version A
** # Move contrib to version X (legacy-27).
