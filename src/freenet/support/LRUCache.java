/**
 * A key-value cache with a fixed size and optional expiration time.
 * The least recently used item is removed if the cache is full and a new entry is added.
 * 
 * Existing entries are only returned if they are not expired.
 * 
 * Notice that expired items are ONLY removed when trying to get() them or when they fall out during push() because they are the
 * least-recently-used.
 * Therefore, this cache is intended for small sizes (or large amounts of small items).
 * 
 * If you want to do a large cache and therefore need periodical garbage collection, please email me and I might implement it.
 * 
 * Pushing and getting are executed in O(lg N) using a tree, to avoid hash collision DoS'es.
