/**
 * A wrapper that overwrites {@link #skip} and delegates to {@link #read} instead.
 *
 * <p>Some implementations of {@link InputStream} implement {@link
 * InputStream#skip} in a way that throws an expecption if the stream
 * is not seekable - {@link System#in System.in} is known to behave
 * that way. For such a stream it is impossible to invoke skip at all
 * and you have to read from the stream (and discard the data read)
 * instead. Skipping is potentially much faster than reading so we do
 * want to invoke {@code skip} when possible. We provide this class so
 * you can wrap your own {@link InputStream} in it if you encounter
 * problems with {@code skip} throwing an excpetion.</p>
