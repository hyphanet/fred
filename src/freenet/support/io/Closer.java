/**
 * Closes various resources. The resources are checked for being
 * <code>null</code> before being closed, and every possible execption is
 * swallowed. That makes this class perfect for use in the finally blocks of
 * try-catch-finally blocks.

 * @version $Id$
 * @deprecated Java 7 has a new language feature which mostly does what this class was for:
 *             <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/exceptions/tryResourceClose.html">The try with-resources Statement</a>.<br/>
 *             There are some differences with regards to swallowing Exceptions, please study them carefully when replacing Closer usage with it.
