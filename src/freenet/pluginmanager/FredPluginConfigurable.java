 * be made in the global Configuration menu dedicated to the plugin's
 * configuration. The plugin must implement the @link FredPluginL10n
 * interface, to allow translation of the config parameter
 * descriptions.
 *
 * The l10n key for the menu label is
 * "ConfigToadlet.full.package.Classname.label". The key for the menu
 * tooltip is "ConfigToadlet.full.package.Classname.tooltip".
 *
 * The parameters are stored in an unencrypted plaintext file in the
 * node's configuration directory using the filename
 * plugin-full.package.Classname.ini.
 *
 * Plugins may force a write of the configuration file by calling
 * pluginRespirator.storeConfig(), but this is only necessary if the
 * plugin modifes a parameter behind the user's back.
