/**
 * <i>NOTICE: This API is a rewrite of the whole code for plugin communication. It was added
 * 2015-03, and for some time after that may change in ways which break backward compatibility.
 * Thus any suggestions or pull requests for improvement of all involved interfaces and classes
 * are welcome!<br>
 * If you would not like to deal with adapting your plugins to possible changes, use the legacy
 * {@link FredPluginFCP} API meanwhile.</i><br><br>
 *
 * FCP server or client plugins which transfer FCP messages to each other using a
 * {@link FCPPluginConnection} must implement this interface by implementing one of it's child
 * interfaces, to provide a function which handles the received messages.<br><br>
 *
 * For symmetry, the child interfaces {@link ClientSideFCPMessageHandler} and
 * {@link ServerSideFCPMessageHandler} do not provide any different functions.<br>
 * They exist nevertheless to allow JavaDoc to explain differences in what the server and client are
 * allowed to do.<br>
 * You <b>must</b> follow the restrictions which are explained there.<br>
 * For clarity, you <b>must</b> implement the child interfaces instead of this interface.<br><br>
 *
 * If you want to specify the thread priority of the message handling functions, you can
 * additionally implement the member interface {@link PrioritizedMessageHandler}.<br><br>
 *
 * As opposed to the old {@link FredPluginFCP} and {@link FredPluginTalker} message handler
 * interfaces, and their {@link PluginReplySender} and {@link PluginTalker} message sending
 * counterparts, this new API is as symmetric as possible:<br>
 * Both the message handler and message sender is now one interface / class shared by both server
 * and client, instead of different ones for each - {@link FredPluginFCPMessageHandler} and
 * {@link FCPPluginConnection}.<br>
 * With the old interface, the server could only <i>reply</i> to messages of the client, it could
 * not send a message without a previous client message.<br>
 * With this implementation, server and client are free to send messages to each others whenever
 * they like to.<br>
 * The only restriction upon this is that the opening and closing of connections is dictated by the
 * client. The server cannot connect to a client on its own.
 *
 * <br><br><h1>Implementing a server</h1><br>
 *
 * All you have to do to allow clients to connect to your plugin by FCP is implement the child
 * interface {@link ServerSideFCPMessageHandler} at your plugin's main class.<br>
 * Freenet will then automatically detect that the main class implements it, and allow clients to
 * connect by FCP.
 *
 * <br><br><h1>Implementing a client</h1><br>
 *
 * Use {@link PluginRespirator#connectToOtherPlugin(String,
 * FredPluginFCPMessageHandler.ClientSideFCPMessageHandler)} to connect to a FCP server plugin.
 *
 * <br><br><h1>Debugging</h1><br>
 *
 * You can configure the {@link Logger} to log "freenet.clients.fcp.FCPPluginConnection:DEBUG" to
 * cause logging of all sent and received messages.<br>
 * This is usually done on the Freenet web interface at Configuration / Logs / Detailed priority
 * thresholds.<br>
 * ATTENTION: The log entries will appear at the time when the messages were queued for sending, not
 * when they were delivered. Delivery usually happens in a separate thread. Thus, the relative order
 * of arrival of messages can be different to the order of their appearance in the log file.<br>
 * If you need to know the order of arrival, add logging to your message handler. Also don't forget
 * that {@link FCPPluginConnection#sendSynchronous(SendDirection, FCPPluginMessage, long)} will not
 * deliver replies to the message handler but only return them instead.<br><br>
 *
 * @author
 *     xor (xor@freenetproject.org)
 * @see FCPPluginConnection
 *     A connection will be represented as class FCPPluginConnection to the client and server
 *     plugin. It's JavaDoc provides an overview of the lifecycle of connections.

		 *
		 * <p>If you ...<br/>
		 * - Need a long time to compute a reply.<br/>
		 * - Need to keep a reference to the client connection because you want to send messages to
		 *   the client after having exited this function; maybe even triggered by events at your
		 *   plugin, not by client messages.<br/>
		 * Then you should:<br/>
		 * - Store the passed {@link FCPPluginConnection}. If you cannot store objects in memory,
		 *   for example because you are using a database, you can get the {@link UUID} of the
		 *   connection via {@link FCPPluginConnection#getID()}, store only that, and then in the
		 *   future get back the connection using
		 *   {@link PluginRespirator#getPluginConnectionByID(UUID)}.<br>
		 * - Compute your reply in another thread.</br>
		 * - Once you're ready to send the reply, send the message using the send functions of the
		 *   {@link FCPPluginConnection}.<br/>
		 * - Notice that there is no explicit disconnection mechanism. Clients can come and go as
		 *   they please. The only way to be sure that a connection is alive is by checking whether
		 *   the client replies to messages.<br>
		 *   Thus, if you store client connections for longer than sending a single reply, make sure
		 *   to prevent excessive growth of your connection database upon client disconnection
		 *   by implementing a garbage collection mechanism as follows:<br>
		 *   Periodically send a message at each connection and check if you get a reply within a
		 *   reasonable timeout to check whether the connection is still alive. Drop the connection
		 *   if not. You may make a "Ping" message with a "Pong" response a requirement for your
		 *   server's protocol.<br>

		 *     The requirement of returning the reply is to ensure that the reply can be clearly
		 *     identified as such, and shipped to the remote side with a clear specification to
		 *     which message it is a reply.<br>
		 *     This is useful for example if the sender of the original message used the
		 *     <i>synchronous</i> send function {@link FCPPluginConnection#sendSynchronous(
		 *     SendDirection, FCPPluginMessage, long)}: The function shall wait for the reply to the
		 *     original message, and return it to the caller. This only works if replies are
		 *     properly identified, otherwise it would have to throw an {@link IOException} to
		 *     signal a timeout while waiting for the reply.<br/><br/>

		 *     String)} (or one of its shortcuts) to ensure that the
		 *     {@link FCPPluginMessage#identifier} gets preserved.<br/><br/>
		 *
		 *     Replies to replies are not allowed: You <b>must</b> return null if the original
		 *     message was a reply message already as indicated by
		 *     {@link FCPPluginMessage#isReplyMessage()}.<br>
		 *     Replies often shall only indicate success / failure instead of triggering actual
		 *     operations, so it could cause infinite bouncing if you reply to them again.<br/>
		 *     If you still have to send a message to do further operations, you should create a new

		 *     Consider the whole of this as a remote procedure call process: A non-reply message is
