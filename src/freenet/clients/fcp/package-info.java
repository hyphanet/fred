/**
 * Freenet Client Protocol support. This is how the node talks to external
 * clients (outside the JVM). Lets the client layer do as much of the work
 * as possible and avoids exposing block level details to the clients,
 * while providing plenty of status info, to avoid clients implementing
 * their own mutually incompatible metadata schemes when this can be
 * avoided. (This does not mean we should never let clients have access to
 * blocks, of course). Supports most functionality, including stats,
 * darknet peers, persistent downloads etc.
 *
 * Some of the messages have support for parsing as a client, some code in
 * @see freenet.tools uses this, but we don't have a proper official Java
 * FCP library.
