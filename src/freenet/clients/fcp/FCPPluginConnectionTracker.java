/**
 * Keeps a list of all {@link FCPPluginConnectionImpl}s which are connected to server plugins
 * running in the node. Allows the server plugins to query a client connection by its {@link UUID}.
 * <br><br>
 *
 * <p>To understand the purpose of this, please consider the following:<br/>
 * The normal flow of plugin FCP is that clients send messages to a server plugin, and the server
 * plugin immediately returns a reply from its message handling function
 * {@link ServerSideFCPMessageHandler#handlePluginFCPMessage(FCPPluginConnection,
 * FCPPluginMessage)}.<br/>
 * This might not be sufficient for certain usecases: The reply to a message might take quite some
 * time to compute, possibly hours. Then a reference to the original client connection needs to be
 * stored in the plugin's database, not memory. A {@link FCPPluginConnection} cannot be
 * serialized into a database, but an {@link UUID} can.<br>
 * Thus, this class exists to serve the purpose of allowing plugin servers to query client
 * connections by their ID (see {@link FCPPluginConnection#getID()}).</p>
 *
 * <p>Client connections are considered as closed once the client discards all strong references
 * to the {@link FCPPluginConnection}. Or in other words: A {@link FCPPluginConnection} is closed
 * once it becomes weakly reachable.<br>
 * Thus, this class is implemented by keeping {@link WeakReference}s to plugin client connections,
 * so they only stay in the memory of the tracker as long as they are still connected.</p>
 *
 * <p>After constructing an object of this class, you must call {@link #start()} to start its
 * garbage collection thread.<br/>
 * For shutdown, no action is required: The thread will be a daemon thread and thus the JVM will
 * deal with shutdown.</p>

     * - The send functions which do not require a {@link SendDirection} will always throw an
     *   exception without an adapter ({@link #send(FCPPluginMessage)} and
     *   {@link #sendSynchronous(FCPPluginMessage, long)}).<br>
     * - Server plugins must not keep a strong reference to the FCPPluginConnectionImpl
     *   to ensure that the client disconnection mechanism of monitoring garbage collection works.
     *   The adapter prevents servers from keeping a strong reference by internally only keeping a
     *   {@link WeakReference} to the FCPPluginConnectionImpl.<br>

     * @param connectionID
     *     The value of {@link FCPPluginConnection#getID()} of a client connection which has already
     *     sent a message to the server plugin via
     *     {@link ServerSideFCPMessageHandler#handlePluginFCPMessage(FCPPluginConnection,
