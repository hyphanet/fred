/**
 * <b>Please first read the JavaDoc of the interface {@link FCPPluginConnection} which specifies
 * this class.</b><br><br>
 *
 * ATTENTION:<br>
 * Objects of this class shall not be handed out directly to server or client applications.
 * Instead, only hand out a {@link DefaultSendDirectionAdapter} - which can be obtained by
 * {@link #getDefaultSendDirectionAdapter(SendDirection)}.<br>
 * This has two reasons:<br>
 * - The send functions which do not require a {@link SendDirection} will always throw an exception
 *   without an adapter ({@link #send(FCPPluginMessage)} and
 *   {@link #sendSynchronous(FCPPluginMessage, long)}).<br>
 * - Server plugins must not keep a strong reference to the FCPPluginConnectionImpl
 *   to ensure that the client disconnection mechanism of monitoring garbage collection works,
 *   see {@link PluginRespirator#connectToOtherPlugin(String, ClientSideFCPMessageHandler)}.
 *   The adapter prevents servers from keeping a strong reference by internally only keeping a
 *   {@link WeakReference} to the FCPPluginConnectionImpl.<br>
 *
 * <h1>Internals</h1><br>
 *
 * This section is not interesting to server or client implementations. You might want to read it
 * if you plan to work on the fred-side implementation of FCP plugin messaging.
 *
 * <h2>Code path of sending messages</h2>
 * <p>There are two possible code paths for client connections, depending upon the location of the
 * client. The server is always running inside the node.<br><br>
 *
 * NOTICE: These two code paths only apply to asynchronous, non-blocking messages. For blocking,
 * synchronous messages sent by {@link #sendSynchronous(SendDirection, FCPPluginMessage, long)},
 * there is an overview at {@link #synchronousSends}. The overview was left out here because they
 * are built on top of regular messages, so the code paths mentioned here mostly apply.<br><br>
 *
 * The two possible paths are:<br/>
 * <p>1. The server is running in the node, the client is not - also called networked FCP
 * connections:<br/>
 * - The client connects to the node via network and sends FCP message of type
 *   <a href="https://wiki.freenetproject.org/FCPv2/FCPPluginMessage">FCPPluginMessage</a> (which
 *   will be internally represented by class {@link FCPPluginClientMessage}).<br/>
 * - The {@link FCPServer} creates a {@link FCPConnectionHandler} whose
 *   {@link FCPConnectionInputHandler} receives the FCP message.<br/>
 * - The {@link FCPConnectionInputHandler} uses {@link FCPMessage#create(String, SimpleFieldSet)}
 *   to parse the message and obtain the actual {@link FCPPluginClientMessage}.<br/>
 * - The {@link FCPPluginClientMessage} uses {@link FCPConnectionHandler#getFCPPluginConnection(
 *   String)} to obtain the FCPPluginConnection to the server.<br/>
 * - The {@link FCPPluginClientMessage} uses {@link FCPPluginConnection#send(SendDirection,
 *   FCPPluginMessage)} to send the message to the server plugin.<br/>
 * - The FCP server plugin handles the message at
 *   {@link ServerSideFCPMessageHandler#handlePluginFCPMessage(FCPPluginConnection,
 *   FCPPluginMessage)}.<br/>
 * - As each FCPPluginConnection object exists for the lifetime of a network connection, the FCP
 *   server plugin may store the UUID of the FCPPluginConnection and query it via
 *   {@link PluginRespirator#getPluginConnectionByID(UUID)}. It can use this to send messages to the
 *   client application on its own, that is not triggered by any client messages.<br/>
 * </p>
 * <p>2. The server and the client are running in the same node, also called intra-node FCP
 * connections:</br>
 * - The client plugin uses {@link PluginRespirator#connectToOtherPlugin(String,
 *   FredPluginFCPMessageHandler.ClientSideFCPMessageHandler)} to try to create a connection.<br/>
 * - The {@link PluginRespirator} uses {@link FCPServer#createFCPPluginConnectionForIntraNodeFCP(
 *   String, FredPluginFCPMessageHandler.ClientSideFCPMessageHandler)} to get a
 *   FCPPluginConnection.<br>
 * - The client plugin uses the send functions of the FCPPluginConnection. Those are the same as
 *   with networked FCP connections.<br/>
 * - The FCP server plugin handles the message at
 *   {@link ServerSideFCPMessageHandler#handlePluginFCPMessage(FCPPluginConnection,
 *   FCPPluginMessage)}. That is the same handler as with networked FCP connections.<br/>
 * - The client plugin keeps a strong reference to the FCPPluginConnection in memory as long as
 *   it wants to keep the connection open.<br/>
 * - Same as with networked FCP connections, the FCP server plugin can store the UUID of the
 *   FCPPluginConnection and in the future re-obtain the connection by
 *   {@link PluginRespirator#getPluginConnectionByID(UUID)}. It can use this to send messages to the
 *   client application on its own, that is not triggered by any client messages. <br/>
 * - Once the client plugin is done with the connection, it discards the strong reference to the
 *   FCPPluginConnection. Because the {@link FCPPluginConnectionTracker} monitors garbage
 *   collection of FCPPluginConnection objects, getting rid of all strong references to a
 *   FCPPluginConnection is sufficient as a disconnection mechanism.<br/>
 *   Thus, an intra-node client connection is considered as disconnected once the
 *   FCPPluginConnection is not strongly referenced by the client plugin anymore. If a server
 *   plugin then tries to obtain the client connection by its UUID again (via the aforementioned
 *   {@link PluginRespirator#getPluginConnectionByID(UUID)}, the get will fail. So if the server
 *   plugin stores connection UUIDs, it needs no special disconnection mechanism except for
 *   periodically trying to send a message to each client. Once obtaining the client connection by
 *   its UUID fails, or sending the message fails, the server can opportunistically purge the UUID
 *   from its database.
 *   <br/>This mechanism also works for networked FCP.<br>
 * </p></p>

     * {@link FCPConnectionHandler#pluginConnectionsByServerName}.<br/>
     * Currently, it seems not necessary:<br/>
     * - It can only become null if the server plugin is unloaded / reloaded. Plugin unloading /
     *   reloading requires user interaction or auto update and shouldn't happen frequently.<br/>
     * - It would only leak one WeakReference per plugin per client network connection. That won't
     *   be much until we have very many network connections. The memory usage of having one thread
     *   per {@link FCPConnectionHandler} to monitor the ReferenceQueue would probably outweigh the
     *   savings.<br/>
     * - We already opportunistically clean the table at FCPConnectionHandler: If the client
     *   application which is behind the {@link FCPConnectionHandler} tries to send a message using
     *   a FCPPluginConnectionImpl whose server WeakReference is null, it is purged from the said
     *   table at FCPConnectionHandler. So memory will not leak as long as the clients keep trying
     *   to send messages to the nulled server plugin - which they probably will do because they did
     *   already in the past.<br/>
     * NOTICE: If you do implement this, make sure to not rewrite the ReferenceQueue polling thread
     *         but instead base it upon {@link FCPPluginConnectionTracker}. You should probably
     *         extract a generic class WeakValueMap from that one and use to to power both the
     *         existing class and the one which deals with this variable here.<br>
     *         Also, once you've implemented ReferenceQueue monitoring, remove
     *         {@link #isServerDead()} as it only was added for the opportunistic cleaning due to
     *         lack of a ReferenceQueue and is an ugly function besides that.

     *   same situation as if the reply was to a <i>non</i>-synchronous send. Non-synchronous sends

     *   reply to be shipped to the message handler interface of the server/client instead of
