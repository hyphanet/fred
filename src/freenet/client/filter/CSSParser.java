/**
 * WARNING: this is not as thorough as the HTML filter - we do not
 * enumerate all possible attributes etc. New versions of the spec could
 * conceivably lead to new risks How this would happen: a) Another way to
 * include URLs, apart from @import and url() (we are safe from new @
 * directives though) b) A way to specify the MIME type of includes, IF
 * those includes could be a risky type (HTML, CSS, etc) This is still FAR
 * more rigorous than the old filter though.
 * <p>
 * If you want extra paranoia, turn on paranoidStringCheck, which will
 * throw an exception when it encounters strings with colons in; then the
 * only risk is something that includes, and specifies the type of, HTML,
 * XML or XSL.
