/**
 * Client layer (support code: metadata, MIME types, container unpacking etc).
 *
 * @see freenet.client#async for most of the actual implementation.
 *     <h1>Overview of the client layer</h1>
 *     <p>The client layer implements high-level requests, i.e. download a whole file from a key,
 *     upload a whole file, etc. Metadata, FEC encoding and decoding, classes to parse the metadata
 *     and decide how to fetch the file, support for files bigger than a single key, support for
 *     fetching files within zip/tar containers, etc. Uses the key implementations, the node itself,
 *     and all the support code. Used by FCP, fproxy, clients, etc.
 *     <p>Requests can be either persistent or transient. For details on persistence, see the
 *     comments at the top of @see freenet.client.async.ClientLayerPersister .
