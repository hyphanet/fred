	 * Called to get a high level representation of the request. This will include:
	 * - Enough information to restart the request from scratch, including fields that can be
	 * changed manually after starting it (priority and client token).
	 * - If the request has completed, full data on its completion, i.e. the MIME type, where it
	 * was eventually stored etc.
	 * - If the request has reached a *simple* final state, i.e. a splitfile download, enough
	 * information to resume the request. This does NOT apply to single block fetches, multi-level
	 * metadata fetches, container fetches etc; it's basically the filename of the splitfile
	 * download plus the metadata that the splitfile may not have (MIME type etc).
	 *
	 * This is called in two cases:
	 * 1) When checkpointing, we write this data so that a request can be recovered even if
	 * serialization fails.
	 * 2) When creating a splitfile, we store it, so that a request can be recovered just from the
	 * splitfile. We do not update this data later on, so when it is restored it may have an out
	 * of date priority or client token.
