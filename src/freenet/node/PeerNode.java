	 * there has been a severe problem e.g. out of memory, bug etc; in that case, waiting

	 * SOLUTION A: Tracking all possible requests which completed since the 
	 * request was sent. CON: This would be rather complex, and I'm not sure
	 * how well it would work when there are many requests in flight; would it
	 * even be possible without stopping sending requests after some arbitrary
	 * threshold? We might need a time element, and would probably need parameters...
	 * SOLUTION B: Enforcing a hard peer limit on both sides, as opposed to 
	 * accepting a request if the *current* usage, without the new request, is 
	 * over the limit. CON: This would break fairness between request types.
	 * 
	 * Of course, the problem with just using a counter is it may need to be 
	 * changed frequently ... FIXME create a better solution!

	 * Fortunately, this is pretty rare. It happens when e.g. we send an SSK,
	 * then we send a CHK, the messages are reordered and the CHK is accepted,
	 * and then the SSK is rejected. Both were GUARANTEED because if they 
	 * are accepted in order, thanks to the mechanism referred to in solution B,
	 * they will both be accepted.
