Announcer.announceAlertIntro=Freenet is connecting to the network - this may take a few minutes. Performance will continue to improve during the next few hours. This will happen each time you shut down Freenet for more than a few minutes, so try to leave it running 24 hours a day if possible.
Announcer.announceAlertTitle=Node Announcing
Announcer.announceDetails=We have recently sent ${recentSentAnnouncements} announcements, ${runningAnnouncements} of which are still running, and added ${addedNodes} nodes (${refusedNodes} nodes have rejected us). We are currently connected to ${connectedSeednodes} seednodes and trying to connect to another ${disconnectedSeednodes}.
Announcer.announceAlertNoSeednodes=There is no seednodes.fref file found, so your Freenet node will not be able to automatically bootstrap itself onto the opennet. Please add some nodes manually, or download the seednodes file from http://downloads.freenetproject.org/alpha/opennet/ .
Announcer.announceLoading=Freenet is currently loading the seednodes file so that it can attempt to announce to the rest of the network. Announcement may take a few minutes.
Announcer.announceDisabledTooOldTitle=Announcement disabled (too old)
Announcer.announceDisabledTooOld=This node appears to be too old to connect to the current Freenet network. We have disabled announcement, since it is not getting anywhere. Please update your node as soon as possible (auto-updating may be waiting for input or it may be disabled).
Announcer.announceDisabledTooOldShort=Your Freenet node has tried to connect to the network but your copy of Freenet is too old. You should upgrade.
Announcer.announceAlertShort=Freenet is trying to connect to the network, it will be slow for a while.
Announcer.coolingOff=For the next ${time} seconds, your Freenet node is waiting for the nodes that it just announced to to connect, if there are not enough nodes it will try a different node.
Announcer.dontKnowAddress=Freenet has not yet been able to determine our IP address, we cannot announce until we know what it is.

ChatForumsToadlet.frost=${frost-freenet}Frost${/frost-freenet} (${frost-web}web link${/frost-web}) - The original Freenet discussion boards client. This has severe spam and denial of service problems, we strongly recommend you run one of the others. Like FMS, this is not part of Freenet, so you will have to install and run it yourself.
ChatForumsToadlet.fms=${fms}FMS${/fms} - The Freenet Message System is a message boards client, which is actively maintained and has a largish community. It is not part of Freenet, so you will have to download it and run it yourself.
ChatForumsToadlet.content2=The Freenet team did not write or review Frost or FMS, and we cannot guarantee their quality. There are many other Freenet plugins and apps (wiki's, real time chat, social networking), you can find them yourself by browsing Freenet.

DarknetAddRefToadlet.title=Connect to a Friend
DarknetAddRefToadlet.explainBoxTitle=Why you should connect to your friends running Freenet
DarknetAddRefToadlet.explainBox1=You can improve Freenet's security by connecting to your friends. That is, to people you actually know who also run Freenet. These can be online acquaintances, but do not add connections to total strangers, as adding strangers as Friends will not improve security much and will cause problems for the network as a whole if lots of people do it. When you have added enough Friends, so that at least 5 are online at all times, you can increase your network security level to HIGH, and only connect to Friends, which is called "darknet mode". This makes it much harder for an attacker to even find out that you are running Freenet, and makes most attacks against your anonymity much harder. Freenet will connect to your friends directly over the Internet, so only add people you can already be easily connected to (family, coworkers, real life friends, online friends) - you should probably avoid connecting directly to your secret contact in Guantanamo!
DarknetAddRefToadlet.explainInstallerWindows=You can find the latest Windows installer in ${filename} or click ${get-windows}here${/get-windows}.
DarknetAddRefToadlet.explainInstallerWindowsNotYet=Freenet has not yet managed to download the Windows installer, however you can get it over Freenet ${link}here${/link}.
DarknetAddRefToadlet.explainInstallerNonWindows=You can find the latest non-Windows installer in ${filename} or click ${get-nonwindows}here${/get-nonwindows}. This is a jar file which must be opened with java; hopefully your friend can double click on it, but if that doesn't work try opening a command line and typing "java -jar ${shortfilename}".
DarknetAddRefToadlet.explainInstallerNonWindowsNotYet=Freenet has not yet managed to download the non-Windows installer, however you can get it over Freenet ${link}here${/link}. This is a jar file which must be opened with java; hopefully your friend can double click on it, but if that doesn't work try opening a command line and typing "java -jar ${shortfilename}".
DarknetAddRefToadlet.explainBox2=In order to connect to a Friend, you need to exchange noderefs with them. A noderef is a small file which contains the information needed for their copy of Freenet ("Freenet node") to connect to yours. You must add their noderef and they must add your noderef, for the two nodes to connect. See below for your noderef.

Higher trust levels give better performance but also less security if the friend decides to attack you, e.g. to try to find out what you are doing on Freenet. If your friend is only a casual acquaintance you might want to set LOW; if you trust them completely you should set HIGH. If you know they don't look after their computer properly and constantly get viruses etc you should reduce it a bit since it might not be them you are connecting to but somebody who has broken into their computer!

FileInsertWizardToadlet.insertCanonical=This will always produce the same key for the same file, so is convenient for filesharing. However, if the bad guys can predict what files you are going to insert, they may be able to use this to trace you a lot more easily.
FileInsertWizardToadlet.insertIntro=There are several different ways to upload (insert) a file to Freenet depending on whether you have uploaded the file before and what your security requirements are:
FileInsertWizardToadlet.insertRandomTitle=Insert a random, safe key
FileInsertWizardToadlet.insertRandom=This is much safer than the first option, but the key will be different every time you or somebody else inserts the key. Use this if you are the original source of some sensitive data.
FileInsertWizardToadlet.insertSpecificKeyTitle=Specify a key
FileInsertWizardToadlet.insertSpecificKey=If you know the exact key you want to insert to, please specify it here. If it is an SSK, USK or KSK, all the data under it will be encrypted randomly like with option 2.
FileInsertWizardToadlet.splitfileCryptoKeyLabel=(optional) Splitfile encryption key (hex) 
FileInsertWizardToadlet.pageTitle=Upload a file to Freenet
FirstTimeWizardToadlet.homepageTitle=Freenet first time wizard!
FirstTimeWizardToadlet.autodetectedSuggestedLimit=Recommended:
FirstTimeWizardToadlet.autoUpdate=Auto-update
FirstTimeWizardToadlet.autoUpdateAutodeploy=Keep Freenet up to date automatically
FirstTimeWizardToadlet.autoUpdateNoAutodeploy=Ask when a new version is available
FirstTimeWizardToadlet.autoUpdateLong=Freenet can automatically keep itself up to date. Do you want it to:
FirstTimeWizardToadlet.browserWarningPageTitle=You must use a separate browser for Freenet!
FirstTimeWizardToadlet.browserWarningIncognitoPageTitle=Using an incognito mode browser for Freenet
FirstTimeWizardToadlet.browserWarningShort=You must use a separate browser (or a browser with privacy/incognito mode) for Freenet!
FirstTimeWizardToadlet.browserWarningIncognitoShort=You are using a browser with incognito mode for Freenet (this is good)
FirstTimeWizardToadlet.browserWarning=We ${bold}strongly${/bold} recommend that you do not use the same web browser to both browse the ordinary web and access Freenet, unless it is in incognito/privacy mode. Browser history stealing attacks in particular may enable malicious websites to determine which Freenet-based websites ("freesites") you have recently visited, breaking your anonymity. Please use a separate browser to access the Freenet web interface. For example, on Windows, the Browse Freenet option in the rabbit icon (in the system tray) will automatically open Google Chrome in incognito mode if it is installed.
FirstTimeWizardToadlet.browserWarningIncognito=You are using a browser with incognito support, such as Google Chrome. This is good. You should avoid accessing Freenet from any browser without incognito mode. If you do, make sure it is a separate browser from the one you use for your regular Internet browsing, or regular web sites might be able to tell what you've been browsing on Freenet.
FirstTimeWizardToadlet.browserWarningSuggestion=Most web browsers, apart from Microsoft Internet Explorer, will work adequately with Freenet, for example Firefox, Opera, Safari, Chrome, and Lynx are known to work. You should install one of these, then copy the current URL from the location bar, and open it in your new browser.
FirstTimeWizardToadlet.browserWarningIncognitoSuggestion=Most web browsers, apart from Microsoft Internet Explorer, will work adequately with Freenet, for example Firefox, Opera, Safari, Chrome, and Lynx are known to work.
FirstTimeWizardToadlet.chooseNodeName=Node name required!
FirstTimeWizardToadlet.chooseNodeNameLong=Please enter a node name in the field below (we recommend a nickname possibly with an email address). This is so that your friends (trusted peers, which you have manually added) can easily tell your node from their other nodes. This is not visible to strangers (untrusted automatically added peers). Note that any friend or stranger may trivially identify you from your IP address, since you are connected to them, but they cannot easily tell what you are requesting.
FirstTimeWizardToadlet.connectToStrangers=Connect to strangers?
FirstTimeWizardToadlet.connectToStrangersLong=To run Freenet, you must connect to at least five other nodes.  These should ideally be run by people whom you know and trust.  If you don't know enough friends running Freenet, you can choose to connect to strangers' nodes as well.  However, connecting to strangers allows others to find out that you are using Freenet and adds some additional security risks.  If you want to keep your use of Freenet secret, this may get you into trouble.
FirstTimeWizardToadlet.enableOpennet=It is possible to turn off stranger connections later on, once you have added enough friends, although you will already have revealed some information to strangers in the meantime.  Freenet is still experimental, and we offer no guarantees about security.
FirstTimeWizardToadlet.enableUPnP=Enable Universal Plug and Play (UPnP). Set this if you have a router on your local Network. Don't set it if you are directly connected to your ISP e.g. via dial-up modem, or have untrusted people on your local network.
FirstTimeWizardToadlet.enableJSTUN=Enable automatic IP address detection via STUN. Uses central servers (also used by e.g. internet telephone programs) to find out your IP address. Turn off if you are concerned about this.
FirstTimeWizardToadlet.opennetYes=I want Freenet to automatically find strangers to connect to. 
FirstTimeWizardToadlet.opennetNo=I have at least 5 friends already using Freenet and I will add their details on the Friends page.
FirstTimeWizardToadlet.welcomeInfoboxTitle=Welcome to Freenet first time wizard!
FirstTimeWizardToadlet.welcomeInfoboxContent1=Welcome to Freenet first time wizard. This tool will enable you to configure your node quickly and easily to get you started.
FirstTimeWizardToadlet.bandwidthLimit=Bandwidth limits
FirstTimeWizardToadlet.bandwidthLimitLong=Please select your internet connection type and speed (download/upload) from the dropdown menu below.
FirstTimeWizardToadlet.bandwidthLimitAfter=Please note that Freenet will always run in background when your computer is turned on (because this improves your node's speed significantly), and will use all available bandwidth up to the limit you set (up to 100KB/sec or so). If you have a monthly quota, you should take this into account when setting a bandwidth limit. The above limits are upload bandwidth limits, usually the download bandwidth usage will be the same as the upload bandwidth usage.
FirstTimeWizardToadlet.bwlimitLowerSpeed=lower speed
FirstTimeWizardToadlet.bwlimitHigherSpeed=higher speed
FirstTimeWizardToadlet.clickContinue=Click here to continue.
FirstTimeWizardToadlet.continue=Continue
FirstTimeWizardToadlet.continueEnd=Click here to start using Freenet!
FirstTimeWizardToadlet.currentPrefix=Current size:
FirstTimeWizardToadlet.currentSpeed=Current limit:
FirstTimeWizardToadlet.datastoreSize=Datastore size
FirstTimeWizardToadlet.datastoreSizeLong=Please select a size for your datastore. The datastore acts like a cache; storing data for the network will help you to get better throughput when requesting popular files. The more space you can afford the better it is for the community and the faster your node and especially your downloads will go.
FirstTimeWizardToadlet.highNetworkThreatLevelWarning=${bold}WARNING${/bold}: You must add friends manually or Freenet will not connect! In high security mode, Freenet only connects to your Friends. These are nodes operated by people you know, which you have added through the Add a Friend page on the Friends menu. This means that Freenet will not function until you have added at least one Friend, and you should add at least 3 for better performance, preferably 5-10. Do not add anyone's node as a Friend unless you know them personally, whether online or offline, as this will harm performance and not improve security.
FirstTimeWizardToadlet.highNetworkThreatLevelCheckbox=I know at least one person already using Freenet, and I will add them on the Friends page.
FirstTimeWizardToadlet.isNetworkTrusted=Is your local network trusted?
FirstTimeWizardToadlet.isNetworkTrustedLong=Is your local network trusted? If you answer yes here all the services provided by your node will be wide open to everyone willing to access them on the given network. You will be able to do selective access controls from the configuration page when the wizard is over.
FirstTimeWizardToadlet.noNetworkIF=No additional network interface found
FirstTimeWizardToadlet.noNetworkIFLong=Freenet hasn't found any additional network interface. It will assume that you will connect to it from your computer and only from it.
FirstTimeWizardToadlet.iDoTrust=Do you trust people connected to ${interface} (${ip})?
FirstTimeWizardToadlet.congratz=Welcome on board!
FirstTimeWizardToadlet.congratzLong=Congratulations, Freenet is ready to use. You can change any of the options you have just set using the Configuration menu. Please note that Freenet will be slow to start with, it will improve over time (or if you have set HIGH network security, you will need to add Friends). You can get started by clicking on the bookmarks on the next page. We wish you a pleasant Freenet experience.
FirstTimeWizardToadlet.memory.64M=64MiB - only if desperate
FirstTimeWizardToadlet.memory.128M=128MiB - bare minimum
FirstTimeWizardToadlet.memory.192M=192MiB - reasonable default
FirstTimeWizardToadlet.memory.256M=256MiB - if you have at least 1GB of RAM
FirstTimeWizardToadlet.memory.512M=512MiB - if you have lots of RAM
FirstTimeWizardToadlet.memoryLimit=Memory usage
FirstTimeWizardToadlet.memoryLimitLong=How much memory would you like to allow Freenet to use? If you have many downloads or uploads queued, Freenet will need more memory. We suggest you not set this below 128MB unless you are really short of RAM. If you have 1GB or more, you should probably set this to at least 256MB. This will take effect after restarting Freenet.
FirstTimeWizardToadlet.networkThreatLevelConfirmTitle.HIGH=WARNING: You must add friends manually or Freenet will not connect!
FirstTimeWizardToadlet.networkThreatLevelConfirmTitle.MAXIMUM=WARNING: You must add friends manually or Freenet will not connect!
FirstTimeWizardToadlet.networkThreatLevelIntroOpennet=Freenet will connect to strangers, so security will be relatively low. You can add friends later if you want. How concerned are you about attacks against by people you don't know?
FirstTimeWizardToadlet.networkThreatLevelIntroDarknet=Freenet will only connect to your friends, making it very difficult for anyone to trace your Freenet usage. How concerned are you about serious, expensive attacks by people you don't know?
FirstTimeWizardToadlet.networkThreatLevelHeaderOpennet=Protection against a stranger attacking you over the internet (connect to strangers)
FirstTimeWizardToadlet.networkThreatLevelHeaderDarknet=Protection against a stranger attacking you over the internet (only connect to friends)
FirstTimeWizardToadlet.networkSecurityPageTitle=Freenet first time wizard! - Network security settings
FirstTimeWizardToadlet.opennetChoicePageTitle=Freenet first time wizard! - Who should Freenet connect to?
FirstTimeWizardToadlet.opennetChoiceTitle=Who should Freenet connect to?
FirstTimeWizardToadlet.opennetChoiceIntroduction=Freenet is designed to prevent your chat messages, downloads, browsing etc from being traced back to you. Freenet can only provide strong protection when you know the people you are directly connected to.
FirstTimeWizardToadlet.opennetChoiceConnectFriends=Only connect to your friends
FirstTimeWizardToadlet.opennetChoiceConnectStrangers=Connect to strangers
FirstTimeWizardToadlet.opennetChoiceConnectFriendsPRO=Very hard to trace anything on Freenet back to you.
FirstTimeWizardToadlet.opennetChoiceConnectFriendsCON=You need at least ${minfriends} friends that use Freenet.
FirstTimeWizardToadlet.opennetChoiceConnectStrangersPRO=No need to know anyone that uses Freenet.
FirstTimeWizardToadlet.opennetChoiceConnectStrangersCON=Much easier to trace your messages, files, etc back to you.
FirstTimeWizardToadlet.opennetChoiceHowSafeIsFreenetToggle=Freenet provides reasonable anonymity and is very hard to block, IF: (touch to see)
FirstTimeWizardToadlet.opennetChoiceHowSafeIsFreenetStupid=You don't do anything stupid (e.g. use your real name, post your home address on a chat board or talk about people you know personally).
FirstTimeWizardToadlet.opennetChoiceHowSafeIsFreenetFriends=You only connect to your friends.
FirstTimeWizardToadlet.opennetChoiceHowSafeIsFreenetTrustworthy=Your friends are trustworthy (but strangers are always worse than friends).
FirstTimeWizardToadlet.opennetChoiceHowSafeIsFreenetNoSuspect=Possible attackers don't know or suspect who or where you are.
FirstTimeWizardToadlet.opennetChoiceHowSafeIsFreenetChangeID=You change your Freetalk identity occasionally.
FirstTimeWizardToadlet.opennetChoiceHowSafeIsFreenetSSK=You always upload files safely. Freenet will remind you how to do this.
FirstTimeWizardToadlet.opennetChoiceHowSafeIsFreenetOS=Your friends keep their computers secure.
FirstTimeWizardToadlet.opennetChoiceHowSafeIsFreenetBigPriv=You are part of a big network (e.g. the main Freenet which you get if enabling connecting to strangers) or part of a private network which the attackers do not know.
FirstTimeWizardToadlet.opennetChoiceHowSafeIsFreenetDistant=You are not too close to strangers. If for instance your friends connect to strangers, you may not be safe against a powerful attacker.
FirstTimeWizardToadlet.opennetChoiceHowSafeIsFreenetBugs=There aren't any horrible bugs in Freenet. Every program of reasonable size contains bugs. We hope no serious ones which would affect your anonymity are left in freenet, but there can’t be final proof. You have been warned!
FirstTimeWizardToadlet.opennetChoiceHowSafeIsFreenetFoot2=For now you probably want to connect to strangers just to get connected. However, a determined attacker may be able to trace your uploads/downloads/chat/etc back to you, so don't do this if you are planning to upload dangerous content. In the long term we hope everyone will connect only to their friends as this is much safer.

FNPPacketMangler.somePeersDisconnectedStillNotAcked=${count} peers forcibly disconnected due to not acknowledging packets.
FNPPacketMangler.somePeersDisconnectedStillNotAckedDetail=${count} of your peers are having severe problems (not acknowledging packets even after 10 minutes). This is probably due to a bug in the code. If this happens a lot, please add your information to the report on the bug tracker at ${link}https://bugs.freenetproject.org/view.php?id=2692${/link} or send it to the support mailing list support@freenetproject.org. Please include this message and what version of Freenet you are running. The affected peers (you may not want to include this in your bug report if they are darknet peers) are:
GIFFilter.invalidHeader=The file does not contain a valid GIF header.
GIFFilter.invalidHeaderTitle=Invalid header
GIFFilter.notGif=The file you tried to fetch is not a GIF. It might be some other file format, and your browser may do something dangerous with it, therefore we have blocked it.

HTMLFilter.failedToParseLabel=The HTML filter failed to parse the page
HTMLFilter.invalidMetaType=Invalid content type in meta tag, not a known HTML format.
HTMLFilter.metaOutsideHead=<meta> tag outside <head>. This is not allowed as it is invalid and assuming it doesn't happen speeds up charset detection.
HTMLFilter.multipleCharsetsInMeta=Multiple <meta> charset declarations. This is confusing, invalid, unsafe and not allowed.
HTMLFilter.textBeforeHTML=Invalid HTML document: Text before <html> tag. We only allow valid HTML documents and not fragments because this makes for more reliable filtering (particularly avoiding charset ambiguity).
HTMLFilter.tooManyNestedStyleOrScriptTags=Too many nested style or script tags - ambiguous or invalid parsing

InsertFreesiteToadlet.title=Upload a freesite
InsertFreesiteToadlet.content1=You can anonymously upload a web site to Freenet ("insert a Freesite"). Once it has been uploaded, it will remain on Freenet for as long as people continue to access it occasionally. It is distributed across the network and therefore also available if your computer is turned off. And the most important fact: If the security level of Freenet has been configured properly it should be very difficult to find out who has uploaded a Freesite.
InsertFreesiteToadlet.content2=Unfortunately we do not yet have a built-in wizard for inserting freesites. We suggest you use jSite, this is a GUI tool for inserting freesites. You can get the latest version of jSite ${jsite-http}from our web site${/jsite-http}, or you can get version ${jsite-freenet-version} ${jsite-freenet}from Freenet${/jsite-freenet} (${jsite-info}more information${/jsite-info}).
InsertFreesiteToadlet.content3=Once you have downloaded jSite, and constructed your website using an HTML editor such as KompoZer (free), work through one of the following tutorials which are hosted on Freenet:
InsertFreesiteToadlet.contentThingamablog=Alternatively, Thingamablog is a user-friendly blog generator, you can download a Freenet-compatible version ${thingamablog}here${/thingamablog} or ${thingamablog-freenet}over Freenet${/thingamablog-freenet}.
InsertFreesiteToadlet.publishExplanation=A short tutorial on how to insert freesites
InsertFreesiteToadlet.freesiteHowtoExplanation=Another, longer tutorial on how to insert freesites

IPDetectorPluginManager.noConnectivity=Your internet connection does not appear to support UDP. Unless this detection is wrong, it is unlikely that Freenet will work on your computer at present.
IPDetectorPluginManager.noConnectivityTitle=No UDP connectivity
IPDetectorPluginManager.noConnectivityshort=Severe connection problems: No UDP connectivity, Freenet will not work!
IPDetectorPluginManager.portRestricted=Your internet connection appears to be behind a port-restricted NAT (router). You will be able to connect to most other users, but not those behind symmetric NATs.
IPDetectorPluginManager.portRestrictedTitle=Port restricted cone NAT detected
IPDetectorPluginManager.restricted=Your internet connection appears to be behind a "restricted cone" NAT (router). You should be able to connect to most other users.
IPDetectorPluginManager.restrictedTitle=Restricted cone NAT detected
IPDetectorPluginManager.suggestForwardPort= You may want to forward the port (UDP port number ${port}) manually. (See http://wiki.freenetproject.org/FirewallAndRouterIssues ).
IPDetectorPluginManager.suggestForwardTwoPorts= You may want to forward the ports (UDP port numbers ${port1} and ${port2}) manually. (See http://wiki.freenetproject.org/FirewallAndRouterIssues ).
IPDetectorPluginManager.suggestForwardPortWithLink= You may want to ${link}forward the port${/link} (UDP port number ${port}) manually (or you may already have done so, Freenet cannot easily detect this).
IPDetectorPluginManager.suggestForwardTwoPortsWithLink= You may want to ${link}forward the ports${/link} (UDP port numbers ${port1} and ${port2}) manually (or you may already have done so, Freenet cannot easily detect this).
IPDetectorPluginManager.symmetric=Your internet connection appears to be behind a symmetric NAT or firewall. You will probably only be able to connect to users directly connected to the internet or behind restricted cone NATs.
IPDetectorPluginManager.symmetricTitle=Symmetric firewall detected
IPDetectorPluginManager.seriousConnectionProblems=Serious connection problems:
IPDetectorPluginManager.connectionProblems=Connection problems:
IPDetectorPluginManager.forwardPortShortMaybeForwarded=Please forward UDP port ${port} (you may have already done this).
IPDetectorPluginManager.forwardPortShortNotForwarded=Please forward UDP port ${port} (it is probably not forwarded).
IPDetectorPluginManager.forwardTwoPortsShortMaybeForwarded=Please forward UDP ports ${port1} and ${port2} (you may have already done this).
IPDetectorPluginManager.forwardTwoPortsShortNotForwarded=Please forward UDP ports ${port1} and ${port2} (they appear not to be forwarded).
IPDetectorPluginManager.forwardPortMaybeForwarded=Your node appears to be behind some sort of NAT (see the connectivity page for details). You should forward UDP (not TCP) port ${port} if possible to improve connectivity. It is possible you have already done this; it takes a while for Freenet to detect a port forward. See ${link}here${/link} for some more information.
IPDetectorPluginManager.forwardPortNotForwarded=Your node appears to be behind some sort of NAT (see the connectivity page for details). You should forward UDP (not TCP) port ${port} if possible to improve connectivity. It appears that the port has not been forwarded, although Freenet cannot be sure. See ${link}here${/link} for some more information. It may take up to 24 hours for Freenet to recognise that you have successfully forwarded the ports.
IPDetectorPluginManager.maybeAlreadyForwarded=You may have already done this (it is hard for Freenet to detect).
IPDetectorPluginManager.forwardTwoPortsMaybeForwarded=Your node appears to be behind some sort of NAT (see the connectivity page for details). You should forward UDP (not TCP) ports ${port1} and ${port2} if possible to improve connectivity. It is possible you have already done this; it takes a while for Freenet to detect a port forward. See ${link}here${/link} for some more information.
IPDetectorPluginManager.forwardTwoPortsNotForwarded=Your node appears to be behind some sort of NAT (see the connectivity page for details). You should forward UDP (not TCP) ports ${port1} and ${port2} if possible to improve connectivity. It appears that the ports have not been forwarded, although Freenet cannot be sure. See ${link}here${/link} for some more information.
IPDetectorPluginManager.portForwardHelpURL=http://wiki.freenetproject.org/FirewallAndRouterIssues
IPDetectorPluginManager.symmetricPS=Your node is behind a symmetric NAT, which is especially problematic, so if you don't forward the port(s), you may not be able to connect to most nodes!
IPUndetectedUserAlert.detecting=Freenet is currently attempting to detect your external IP address. If this takes more than a few minutes there is something wrong...
IPUndetectedUserAlert.detectingShort=Freenet is currently attempting to detect your external IP address.
IPUndetectedUserAlert.detectingWithConfigLink=Freenet is currently attempting to detect your external IP address. If this takes more than a few minutes there is something wrong and you can use the Temporary IP Address Hint ${link}configuration parameter${/link}.
IPUndetectedUserAlert.loadDetectPlugins=Freenet is unable to detect your external IP address, and no IP detection plugins are currently loaded. It will be very difficult for Freenet to connect to other nodes. Please go to the ${plugins}Plugins page${/plugins} and load the UPnP and JSTUN plugins. Alternatively if you have a static IP address or domain name, please tell Freenet about it using the "IP address override" option on the ${config}configuration page${/config}.
IPUndetectedUserAlert.noDetectorPlugins=Freenet is unable to detect your IP address! Please load the UPnP and JSTUN plugins!
IPUndetectedUserAlert.unknownAddress=Freenet was unable to determine your external IP address (or the IP address of your NAT or Firewall). You can still exchange references with other people, however this will only work if the other user is not behind a NAT or Firewall. As soon as you have connected to one other user in this way, Freenet will be able to determine your external IP address. You can determine your current IP address and tell your node with the 'Temporary IP address hint' ${link}configuration parameter${/link}.
IPUndetectedUserAlert.unknownAddressTitle=Unknown external address
IPUndetectedUserAlert.unknownAddressWithConfigLink=Freenet was unable to determine your external IP address (or the IP address of your NAT-device or firewall). You can still exchange references with other people, however this will only work if the other user is not behind a NAT-device or firewall. As soon as you have connected to one other user in this way, Freenet will be able to determine your external IP address. You can determine your current IP address and tell your node with the 'Temporary IP address hint' ${link}configuration parameter${/link}.
IPUndetectedUserAlert.unknownAddressShort=Freenet was unable to determine your IP address. You may have problems connecting.
IPUndetectedUserAlert.suggestForwardPort=Also, it would be a good idea to forward the port ${port} (UDP) on your router to make it easy to connect to your node.
IPUndetectedUserAlert.suggestForwardTwoPorts=Also, it would be a good idea to forward the ports ${port1} and ${port2} (UDP) on your router to make it easy to connect to your node.

InvalidAddressOverrideUserAlert.unknownAddress=Freenet has determined that the currently configured ipAddressOverride value is invalid, meaning that it does not match the syntax for a valid hostname, IPv4 address or IPv6 address (in the opinion of the current implementation of the function that checks the IPv6 address syntax).
InvalidAddressOverrideUserAlert.unknownAddressTitle=Invalid Address Override Value
InvalidAddressOverrideUserAlert.unknownAddressWithConfigLink=Freenet has determined that the currently configured ipAddressOverride value is invalid, meaning that it does not match the syntax for a valid hostname, IPv4 address or IPv6 address (in the opinion of the current implementation of the function that checks the IPv6 address syntax). You can correct the 'IP address override' ${link}configuration parameter${/link}.
InvalidAddressOverrideUserAlert.unknownAddressShort=Your ipAddressOverride is bogus. Please fix it. 
IntOption.parseError=The value specified can't be parsed as a 32-bit integer : ${val}
JPEGFilter.notJpeg=The file you tried to fetch is not a JPEG. It might be some other file format, and your browser may do something dangerous with it, therefore we have blocked it.
KnownUnsafeContentTypeException.dangerousInlines=This type of content can contain inline images or videos, and can therefore load content from the non-anonymous open Web, exposing your IP address.
KnownUnsafeContentTypeException.dangerousInlinesLabel=Dangerous inlines:
KnownUnsafeContentTypeException.dangerousLinks=This type of content can contain links to the non-anonymous Web; if you click on them (and they may be disguised), this may expose your IP address.
KnownUnsafeContentTypeException.dangerousLinksLabel=Dangerous links:
KnownUnsafeContentTypeException.dangerousMetadata=This type of content can contain metadata which may be displayed by some browsers or other software, which may contain dangerous links or inlines.
KnownUnsafeContentTypeException.dangerousMetadataLabel=Dangerous metadata:
KnownUnsafeContentTypeException.dangerousScripts=This type of content can contain dangerous scripts which when executed may compromise your anonymity by connecting to the open Web or otherwise breach security.
KnownUnsafeContentTypeException.dangerousScriptsLabel=Dangerous scripting:
KnownUnsafeContentTypeException.knownUnsafe=This is a potentially dangerous content type. If Freenet lets it through, your browser may do bad things leading to compromise of your anonymity, and your IP address being exposed in connection with this page. In particular:
KnownUnsafeContentTypeException.noFilter=Since there is no built-in filter for this data, you should take the utmost of care!
KnownUnsafeContentTypeException.title=Known dangerous type: ${type}

LogConfigHandler.dirName=Logging directory
LogConfigHandler.dirNameLong=Directory into which to put log files
LogConfigHandler.enabled=Enable logging?
LogConfigHandler.enabledLong=Set to false to completely disable logging
LogConfigHandler.maxBacklogNotBusy=Max time between writing logs (milliseconds)
LogConfigHandler.maxBacklogNotBusyLong=Maximum time the node will hold logging data in RAM for if it is not working flat-out writing it to disk. Higher values mean fewer, larger disk writes and hence better system performance, but also mean if you are debugging you will see the results later.
LogConfigHandler.maxCachedBytes=Max cached log bytes in RAM
LogConfigHandler.maxCachedBytesLong=Maximum number of bytes of logging cached in RAM
LogConfigHandler.maxCachedLines=Max cached log lines in RAM

If you are worried about your computer being seized, set this to ERROR to minimise any possible information leakage.
LogConfigHandler.rotationInterval=Log rotation interval
LogConfigHandler.rotationIntervalLong=Log rotation interval - period after which logs are rotated. We keep the last two log files (current and prev), plus lots of compressed logfiles up to maxZippedLogsSize
LoggerHook.unrecognizedPriority=Unrecognised priority name: ${name}.
LongOption.parseError=The value specified can't be parsed as a 64-bit integer : ${val}
MeaningfulNodeNameUserAlert.noNodeNick=It seems that your node doesn't know your nickname. Putting your e-mail address or IRC nickname here is generally speaking a good idea and helps your friends to identify your node (note that only your darknet peers listed on the friends page can see your node name, it will not be displayed to strangers).
MeaningfulNodeNameUserAlert.noNodeNickTitle=Your node name isn't defined.
MeaningfulNodeNameUserAlert.noNodeNickShort=Your node name isn't defined.
MP3Filter.bogusMP3NoFrames=Doesn't look like an MP3.
MP3Filter.bogusMP3NoFramesExplanation=This does not look like and MP3 file. It might be corrupt or somebody might be trying to mask some other kind of file as an mp3 file to breach your anonymity.
MP3Filter.freeBitrateNotSupported=Free bitrate MP3 files not supported by filter
MP3Filter.freeBitrateNotSupportedExplanation=The file appears to be an mp3 file with the "free bitrate" extension, which allows non-standard bitrates. These are not supported by most players and so are relatively rare. Nonetheless the file is probably safe if you are careful and your player doesn't do silly things, like rendering web URLs as links.
N2NTMToadlet.composingMessageLabel=Composing N2NTM to send to the following peers:
N2NTMToadlet.delayed=Backed off: Sending of message possibly delayed to peer

N2NTMUserAlert.reply=Reply
N2NTMUserAlert.title=Node to Node Text Message ${number} from ${peername} (${peer})
Node.acceptSeedConnectionsShort=Be a seednode?
Node.acceptSeedConnections=If true, the node will accept connections from new insecure-mode nodes and help to bootstrap them onto the network. This allows any node with your noderef to connect, but only for purposes of announcement: it can only do requests to nodes that it gets through the announcement (possibly including this node if we don't have many Strangers).
Node.alwaysAllowLocalAddresses=Always allow connecting to nodes via local addresses?
Node.alwaysAllowLocalAddressesLong=If true, Freenet will attempt to connect to other nodes via their local (localhost, LAN) addresses as well as their public IPs. If this is not set, you can still enable it for specific darknet peers (but not opennet peers). Set this if you want to connect to other nodes on the same LAN or computer, and don't mind that bogus references can cause your node to send UDP packets to machines on your LAN.
Node.assumeNATed=Assume the port is not forwarded.
Node.assumeNATedLong=Should Freenet assume the port is NATed and not forwarded, and always send handshakes aggressively (every 10-30 seconds), regardless of any evidence to the contrary?
Node.autoChangeDatabaseEncryption=Automatically encrypt or decrypt node.db4o on restarting the node?
Node.autoChangeDatabaseEncryptionLong=Automatically encrypt or decrypt node.db4o on restart (or on first entering the password) if the security level has changed? (It is encrypted unless physical security level is LOW). This can take some time during startup, but if it is disabled, you will have to shut down Freenet, remove node.db4o(.crypt), and start it back up to change whether it is encrypted, which will wipe out your downloads/uploads queue. 
Node.bandwidthLimitMustBePositiveOrMinusOne=Bandwidth limit must be positive or -1
Node.bindTo=IP address to bind to
Node.bindToLong=IP address to bind to
Node.bwlimitMustBePositive=Bandwidth limit must be positive
Node.clientCacheType=Client cache type?
Node.clientCacheTypeLong=If you set this to none there will be less evidence if your computer is seized, but your node will need to re-fetch every page you visit every time you visit it, reducing performance and making your requests more visible on the network; if you set it to ram, cached pages will only be remembered until shutting down this Freenet node and will take up RAM; the first-time wizard sets it to salt-hash, which stores visited freesites on disk, but encrypted and possibly passworded according to the physical security level (so securely deleting master.keys will wipe the client cache).
Node.clientCacheSize=Size of the client cache? (bytes, MB, GB etc allowed)
Node.clientCacheSizeLong=Set the size of the client cache. This is used to cache freesites you visit so that they won't need to be requested next time, and therefore will load faster and won't be visible on the network. If the client cache type is "none", this option is ignored; if it is "ram", this option is the size in RAM of the client cache (part of by the overall maximum memory limit, so increase that if you need to); if it is "salt-hash", this option is the size of the client-cache on disk.
Node.connectToSeednodesCannotBeChangedMustDisableOpennetOrReboot=Connect to seednodes setting: Cannot disable while opennet is running, either disable and then re-enable opennet or restart Freenet.
Node.databaseMemory=Datastore maximum memory usage (OBSOLETE: bdbje-index only!)
Node.databaseMemoryLong=Only valid with bdbje-index datastore type. Maximum memory usage of the database backing the datastore indexes, 0 means no limit (limited to ~ 30% of maximum memory)
Node.deadlockTitle=Deadlocking likely due to buggy JVM/kernel combination
Node.defragDatabaseOnStartup=Defragment the downloads database during the next startup?
Node.defragDatabaseOnStartupLong=If true, the database will be defragmented during the next startup (or after the password is entered).
Node.defragOnce=Defrag once only (set above option as well!)
Node.defragOnceLong=If this and the above option is true, we will defragment on the next startup and then turn off the defragment option.
Node.disablePHTLS=Disable probabilistic HTL
Node.disablePHTLSLong=Disable probabilistic HTL (don't touch this unless you know what you are doing)
Node.dropPacketEvery=Testing packet drop frequency
Node.dropPacketEveryLong=Frequency of dropping packets. Testing option used by devs to simulate packet loss. 0 means never artificially drop a packet. Don't touch this!
Node.enableARKs=Enable ARKs? (DON'T TURN THIS OFF!)
Node.enableARKsLong=Enable ARKs? (DON'T TURN THIS OFF!).
Node.enableOpennetFailedTitle=Enabling opennet failed
Node.enableOpennetFailed=Freenet failed to enable opennet, and cannot connect to strangers. You will need to fix this, report a bug, or stick with connecting only to Friends. Details: ${message}
Node.enablePacketCoalescing=Enable packet coalescing?
Node.enablePacketCoalescingLong=Enable packet coalescing? Packet coalescing increases bandwidth efficiency, reduces CPU usage and gains some resistance to traffic analysis at a small cost in message latency. Don't turn this off unless you know what you're doing.
Node.enablePerNodeFailureTables=Enable per-node failure tables?
Node.enablePerNodeFailureTablesLong=Enable automatically rerouting around nodes that failed a request within the last 10 minutes?
Node.enableSwapping=Enable location swapping? (DO NOT TURN THIS OFF!)
Node.enableSwappingLong=Enable location swapping? (DO NOT TURN THIS OFF! It is only useful in some simulations).
Node.enableSwapQueueing=Enable queueing of swap requests? (DO NOT TURN THIS OFF!)
Node.enableSwapQueueingLong=Enable queueing of swap requests? (DO NOT TURN THIS OFF!)
Node.enableULPRDataPropagation=Enable ULPR data propagation?
Node.enableULPRDataPropagationLong=Enable fast propagation of recently requested keys to those nodes which have asked for them when the data is eventually found? (Ultra-Lightweight Persistent Requests). 
Node.errorApplyingConfig=Error while applying the new config : ${error}
Node.forceBigShrink=Do large store shrinks immediately (bdbje-index store type only)
Node.forceBigShrinkLong=Whether to do large store shrinks (over 10%) immediately (rather than waiting for the next node restart). Online shrinks do not preserve the most recently used data, so this is not recommended; use it only if you must have an immediate result. Specific to bdbje-index store type.
Node.inBWLimit=Download bandwidth limit (bytes per second, KB MB etc allowed)
Node.inBWLimitLong=Download bandwidth limit (bytes/sec, e.g. 200K); Freenet will try not to exceed this, but it is not very accurate; -1 = 4x set outputBandwidthLimit.
Node.invalidStoreSize=Store size must be at least 32MB
Node.java15DeprecatedTitle=Please upgrade to Java 1.6 or Freenet will stop working!
Node.java15Deprecated=Freenet will soon require Java 1.6. Please upgrade your JVM or Freenet may stop working!
Node.l10nLanguage=The language Freenet will use to display messages
Node.l10nLanguageLong=This setting will change the language used to display messages. Keep in mind that some strings won't be translated until next node startup though.
Node.masterKeyFile=Location of the master keys file
Node.masterKeyFileLong=Filename for the master keys file. This contains the encryption keys for the cache of recently visited sites (client-cache), the download queue etc. These may be passworded through the security levels page, but securely deleting the keys file will make them useless even with the password. (If this is a relative path, it will be taken relative to the user data directory.)
Node.maxHTL=Maximum HTL
Node.maxHTLLong=Maximum HTL (FOR DEVELOPER USE ONLY!)
Node.maxOpennetPeers=Maximum number of Opennet peers
Node.maxOpennetPeersLong=Maximum number of Opennet peers (must be between 0 and 40 inclusive, the actual limit will depend on the number of Friends and your bandwidth limit, and will be shown on the statistics page).
Node.maxOpennetPeersMustBeTwentyOrLess=Must be forty or less
Node.mustBePositive=Config value must be positive
Node.nodeDir=Node-reference directory
Node.nodeDirLong=Path of directory for node-related information (e.g. node identity, peers).
Node.cfgDir=Config directory
Node.cfgDirLong=Path of directory for user-editable config (e.g. language overrides).
Node.userDir=User data directory
Node.userDirLong=Path of directory for user data (e.g. bookmarks, download lists).
Node.runDir=Run-time state directory
Node.runDirLong=Path of directory for run-time state. This can be cleared out when Freenet is not running.
Node.pluginDir=Plugin directory
Node.pluginDirLong=Path of directory for plugins.
Node.nodeName=Nickname for this Freenet node
Node.nodeNameLong=Node nickname. This will be visible to your friends only.
Node.notEnoughSpaceToAutoEncryptTitle=Insufficient disk space to encrypt the downloads queue!
Node.notEnoughSpaceToAutoEncrypt=There is not enough space so the downloads/uploads queue has not been encrypted. If your node is seized attackers will be able to see what you have downloaded! You should clear enough disk space for the migration (${size}) and restart, or securely delete ${file} (shut down the node first), or switch physical security levels to LOW if you don't need to encrypt it.
Node.notEnoughSpaceToAutoDecryptTitle=Insufficient disk space to decrypt the downloads queue!
Node.notEnoughSpaceToAutoDecrypt=There is not enough space so the downloads queue has not been decrypted. Your node will be slightly slower, but this probably isn't a problem. You can shut down your node and remove ${file} if you want to wipe the downloads database, or free up ${size} and restart.
Node.failedToRenameEncryptingTitle=Failed to rename the downloads queue database while encrypting, downloads database is offline.
Node.failedToRenameEncrypting=The node was unable to rename the downloads queue database from ${fromfile} to ${tofile} while encrypting it. The downloads database is not accessible until you rename it manually.
Node.failedToRenameDecryptingTitle=Failed to rename the downloads queue database while decrypting, downloads database is offline.
Node.failedToRenameDecrypting=The node was unable to rename the downloads queue database from ${fromfile} to ${tofile} while decrypting it. The downloads database is not accessible until you rename it manually.
Node.maxPacketSize=Maximum packet size (aka MTU)
Node.maxPacketSizeLong=Maximum size of the UDP packets Freenet sends, assuming UDP/IP headers are 28 bytes. We will use the MTU of the interface if we can detect it, but mostly obstructions happen elsewhere, and unfortunately we cannot easily detect the path MTU.
Node.notUsingSunVMTitle=Not using a Sun/Oracle Java
Node.notUsingSunVM=You are trying to run Freenet under a non-Sun/Oracle Java: ${vendor} ${version} (${name}). This is not recommended: Freenet may not run well. Please get Sun/Oracle Java from http://www.java.com/getjava/ if possible.
Node.notUsingSunVMShort=Freenet is running on a non-Sun/Oracle Java, this is not recommended, please get the latest Sun/Oracle Java. 
Node.notUsingWrapperTitle=Not using the wrapper!
Node.notUsingWrapper=You are running Freenet without the wrapper. This is not recommended. Freenet will not be able to restart itself, so auto-updating won't work, and if Java crashes, it won't get restarted either. Also Freenet can't generate stack dumps in some places so debugging will be marginally harder.
Node.notUsingWrapperShort=Freenet is running without the wrapper. This is not recommended.
Node.oneConnectionPerIP=Limit to one connection per address? (friends)
Node.oneConnectionPerIPLong=Don't allow more than one friend connection per address? This will make it slightly harder for an attacker to connect more than once to your node as different identities, in order to dominate your routing or make harvesting easier. Also prevents having the same node connected as a friend and stranger simultaneously. Note that this applies to the external IP address, so you should turn this off if you have multiple nodes on a LAN connected as friends.
Node.opennetEnabled=Enable insecure mode (automatically connect to untrusted nodes)?
Node.opennetEnabledLong=Enable insecure mode (aka opennet)? If this is enabled, your Freenet node will automatically exchange node references with other untrusted nodes (Strangers as opposed to Friends). But this means that the fact that you are running a node is no longer private, and many attacks are much easier. If you know enough people running Freenet, you should stick to trusted (Friends) connections to them, and turn this off.
Node.outBWLimit=Output bandwidth limit (bytes per second, KB MB etc allowed)
Node.outBWLimitLong=Hard output bandwidth limit (bytes/sec); Freenet should almost never exceed this. Normally you should set this to no more than half the your internet connection's upload bandwidth, which is usually much less than your download bandwidth.
Node.paddDataPackets=Pad data packets sent by this Freenet node with random data of random length? (READ WARNING BEFORE TURNING OFF!)
Node.paddDataPacketsLong=Pad data packets sent by this Freenet node with random-length content? For security, on a single node, turning this off is bad; if a large part of the network starts doing it, we become very vulnerable to a passive attacker. However, it should improve performance, particularly the payload percentage. You have been warned!
Node.passOpennetPeersThroughDarknet=Relay opennet noderefs through darknet peers?
Node.passOpennetPeersThroughDarknetLong=If true, opennet noderefs (NEVER our own darknet noderef) will be relayed through our darknet peers. So a node (this node, or its peers) can get opennet peers from its darknet peers. This is useful because it allows us to bootstrap new opennet peers after having lost our peers due to downtime, for example. However, it may make traffic analysis slightly easier, so turn it off if you are paranoid.
Node.port=Darknet port number (UDP)
Node.portLong=UDP port used by Freenet to communicate with your Friends' nodes. This port should be forwarded in your router if possible. We use a separate port for connections to Strangers.
Node.opennetPort=Opennet port number (UDP)
Node.opennetPortLong=UDP port used by Freenet to communicate with Strangers i.e. freenet nodes running in opennet mode. This port should be forwarded in your router if possible. We use a separate port for connections to your Friends' nodes.
Node.publishOurPeersLocation=Shall we send our peers' locations to our peers?
Node.publishOurPeersLocationLong=Shall we send our peers' locations to our peers? Doing so helps routing but gives some information away to a potential attacker.
Node.routeAccordingToOurPeersLocation=Shall we use the locations of the peers of our peers into account for routing purposes?
Node.routeAccordingToOurPeersLocationLong=Shall we use the locations of the peers of our peers into account for routing purposes? Doing so helps routing but might help a potential attacker.
Node.skipWrapperWarning=Skip "not using the wrapper" warning?
Node.skipWrapperWarningLong=If true, the "not using the wrapper" warning will not be shown. Note that this will only hide the warning from the next restart on.
Node.slashdotCacheLifetime=How long to keep data in the recent requests cache?
Node.slashdotCacheLifetimeLong=How long to keep data in the recent requests cache (milliseconds, use k for seconds)? Note that this goes away on restart anyway.
Node.slashdotCacheSize=Maximum size of the recent requests cache (in bytes, KB MB GB TB etc)
Node.slashdotCacheSizeLong=Maximum size of the recent requests cache (note that there is also a time limit).
Node.storeDirectory=Store directory
Node.storeDirectoryLong=Name of directory to put store files in
Node.storeMaxMemTooHigh=Giving more than 80% of your ram to BDB is probably not what you want to do!
Node.storePreallocate=Preallocate space for datastore
Node.storePreallocateLong=Preallocate space for datastore
Node.storeSaltHashResizeOnStart=Resize store on node start (salt-hash only)
Node.storeSaltHashResizeOnStartLong=Resize store on node start (salt-hash only). If this is true, Freenet will complete resizing the datastore during startup. This will complete much faster than doing it "on the fly", but on the other hand your Freenet node will not be available for some time while it completes the resize.
Node.storeSaltHashMigratedShort=Datastore migration finished!
Node.storeSaltHashMigrated=Datastore migration finished! You may now delete the old datastore files:
Node.storeSize=Freenet datastore size (bytes, MB GB TB etc allowed)
Node.storeSizeLong=Size of the Freenet datastore, which includes the store and cache, and stores data passing through your node. Freenet uses disk space for many other things, such as temporary files and your downloads, which are separate.
Node.storeType=Datastore type (LEAVE THIS ALONE)
Node.storeTypeLong=Datastore type. Currently this can be salt-hash (this is the default, stores data on disk with a lossy hashtable and a Bloom filter), bdb-index (old store format, not recommended), or ram (FOR TESTING ONLY, keep the index and the data in memory, not on disk). Only use ram if you know what you are doing and have enough RAM to store all your data (and note it will not be saved on shutdown)! Changes will not take effect until Freenet has been restarted.
Node.storeBloomFilterSize=Bloom filter size (total) in bytes
Node.storeBloomFilterSizeLong=Bloom filter size (total) in bytes. Usually 1/2048th the size of data store is more than enough. Set this to zero to disable bloom filter. Set this to -1 to reset to default.
Node.storeBloomFilterCounting=Use counting bloom filter?
Node.storeBloomFilterCountingLong=Use 2-bit counting bloom filter? (don't touch this unless you know what you are doing)
Node.sunJVMxmlRemoteCodeExecTitle=Upgrade your Java immediately! Freenet has disabled important functions including search to limit damage due to a severe vulnerability in your outdated Java version! PLEASE DO NOT USE THAW, FROST OR FREETALK, and if you have untrusted people on your local network then please SHUT DOWN FREENET NOW!
Node.sunJVMxmlRemoteCodeExec=Your installed version of Java is vulnerable to a severe remote exploit (remote code execution!). You must upgrade to at least Java 5 update 20 or Java 6 update 15 as soon as possible. Freenet has disabled any plugins handling XML for the time being, but this includes searching and chat so you should upgrade ASAP! See http://www.cert.fi/en/reports/2009/vulnerability2009085.html for details. Also, please do not use Thaw or Freetalk. The UPnP plugin is enabled, it might present a risk if you have bad guys on your LAN, but without it Freenet will not be able to port forward and will have severe problems.
Node.openJDKMightBeVulnerableXML=Please update Java! Your Java might be vulnerable to a severe remote code execution exploit. Unfortunately it is difficult for Freenet to detect whether it is fixed or not. If you are not sure, please do not run Thaw or Freetalk until you have updated Java (probably via your operating system's updating mechanism) and restarted Freenet and Thaw. This is CVE-2009-2625, but be warned that the original report said it was a denial of service (relatively minor); it's really a remote code execution bug, which is far more serious.
Node.swapRInterval=Swap request send interval (ms)
Node.swapRIntervalLong=Interval between swap attempting to send swap requests in milliseconds. Leave this alone!
Node.throttleLocalTraffic=Throttle local traffic?
Node.throttleLocalTrafficLong=Throttle local traffic? If enabled, even LAN and localhost traffic will be subject to bandwidth limiting.
Node.tooSmallMTU=Too small MTU
Node.tooSmallMTULong=Your connection's MTU appears to be ${mtu} bytes. Freenet will not function well with an MTU of less than ${minMTU} bytes: connections will be unreliable and possibly slow. Please fix the problem if possible.
Node.tooSmallMTUShort=Connection problems: Your connection's MTU is too short for Freenet to work well. Expect problems.
Node.useSlashdotCache=Cache all requests for 30 minutes?
Node.useSlashdotCacheLong=Requests with high HTL are not eligible to be stored in the datastore. If this option is true, they will be stored in the recent requests cache, a special short-term cache. If this option is false then only ULPR responses (i.e. delayed answers to requests) will be stored in this cache. This is enabled by default unless network security level is MAXIMUM, as it is important for performance when a key becomes popular suddenly. However, it does have some security impact, in that if an attacker can get close to the target within 30 minutes (unlikely in most cases), this mechanism may help him to confirm his guesses.
Node.withAnnouncement=Allow Freenet to bootstrap itself using seednodes? (Leave this alone unless you know what you're doing)
Node.withAnnouncementLong=Allow your Freenet node to bootstrap itself using seednodes? To get onto the opennet (the Strangers network, automatic Freenet connection on low/normal network security level), we contact public nodes chosen from a small list shipped with Freenet. Obviously this is somewhat insecure, but if you are using opennet, you probably need it: if your node is down for a while, especially if it is NATed and/or changes its IP address, it will probably need to reseed. If you want better security, you need to connect to your friends and enable high network security.
Node.writeLocalToDatastore=Write local and nearby requests to the datastore?
Node.writeLocalToDatastoreLong=Whether to write data returned by high HTL (local and nearby) requests to the main persistent datastore. Strongly recommend you keep this option disabled unless you don't care about either datastore seizure or store probing attacks. Will be enabled by default only if the network security level and physical security level are both LOW.
NodeClientCore.alwaysCommit=Commit after every database job?
NodeClientCore.alwaysCommitLong=If this option is false, we commit the database to disk every 30 seconds. If it is true we commit it after every database job. This will reduce performance but will ensure that no progress is lost on an unclean shutdown, and slightly reduce memory usage. Normally this should be false, to reduce disk access.
NodeClientCore.maxArchiveSize=Maximum size of any given archive
NodeClientCore.maxArchiveSizeLong=Maximum size of any given archive
NodeClientCore.couldNotFindOrCreateDir=Could not find or create directory
NodeClientCore.downloadAllowedDirs=Directories downloading is allowed to

If this is set to "all" any user with access to FCP can download any file to anywhere on your computer!
NodeClientCore.downloadDir=Default download directory
NodeClientCore.downloadDirLong=The directory to save downloaded files into by default
NodeClientCore.encryptPersistentTempBuckets=Encrypt the persistent temporary buckets? LEAVE THIS ALONE!
NodeClientCore.encryptPersistentTempBucketsLong=Encrypt the persistent temporary buckets? In some cases (if you use hard-drive and swap encryption) it might not make sense to encrypt persistent temporary buckets. LEAVE THIS ALONE IF YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING!
NodeClientCore.encryptTempBuckets=Encrypt the temporary buckets? LEAVE THIS ALONE!
NodeClientCore.encryptTempBucketsLong=Encrypt the temporary buckets? In some cases (if you use hard-drive and swap encryption) it might not make sense to encrypt temporary buckets. LEAVE THIS ALONE IF YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING!
NodeClientCore.fileForClientStats=File to store client statistics in
NodeClientCore.fileForClientStatsLong=File to store client throttling statistics in (used to decide how often to send requests)
NodeClientCore.maxUSKFetchers=Maximum number of allowed USK fetchers
NodeClientCore.maxUSKFetchersLong=Maximum number of allowed USK fetchers
NodeClientCore.maxUSKFetchersMustBeGreaterThanZero=Must be greater than zero
NodeClientCore.movingTempDirOnTheFlyNotSupported=Moving temp directory on the fly not supported at present
NodeClientCore.persistentTempDir=Persistent temp files directory
NodeClientCore.persistentTempDirLong=Name of directory to put persistent temp files in
NodeClientCore.maxRAMBucketSize=Maximum size of a RAMBucket (bytes, KB MB etc allowed)
NodeClientCore.maxRAMBucketSizeLong=Maximum size of a RAMBucket (bigger buckets will be kept as files on the disk)
NodeClientCore.ramBucketPoolSize=Amount of RAM to dedicate to temporary buckets (bytes, KB MB etc allowed)
NodeClientCore.ramBucketPoolSizeLong=Amount of RAM to dedicate to temporary buckets. The tradeoff is more memory usage against more IOs.
NodeClientCore.startingUpTitle=Freenet is starting up
NodeClientCore.startingUp=Please allow Freenet a few moments to complete the startup process, in the meantime some things may not work and Freenet may be slower than usual.
NodeClientCore.startingUpShort=Freenet is starting up, some things may not work and it may be slow.
NodeClientCore.tempDir=Temp files directory
NodeClientCore.tempDirLong=Name of directory to put temporary files in
NodeClientCore.uploadAllowedDirs=Directories uploading is allowed from
NodeClientCore.uploadAllowedDirsLong=Semicolon separated list of directories from which uploads are allowed. Empty means no uploads from disk allowed, "all" means uploads allowed from anywhere (including system files etc!). WARNING! If this is set to "all" any file on your computer can be uploaded by any user with access to FCP.
NodeIPDectector.inclLocalAddress=Include local addresses in noderef
NodeIPDectector.inclLocalAddressLong=Whether to include local addresses (LAN and localhost) in node references. This will not be useful unless the both sides set allowLocalAddresses=true for the respective references (use the Friends page in advanced mode to set this flag).
NodeIPDectector.ipOverride=IP address override
NodeIPDectector.ipOverrideLong=IP address override (not usually needed) - set this if you have a *static* IP address or a domain name (e.g. via dyndns), and you are behind a firewall.
NodeIPDectector.tempAddressHint=Temporary IP address hint
NodeIPDectector.tempAddressHintLong=Temporary hint to what our IP might be; deleted after use
NodeIPDetector.maybeSymmetric=It looks like your node may be behind a symmetric NAT. You may have connection problems: If you are behind a symmetric NAT you will probably only be able to connect to peers which are open to the internet.
NodeIPDetector.maybeSymmetricTitle=Connection problems
NodeIPDetector.maybeSymmetricShort=Connection problems: You may be behind a symmetric NAT.
NodeIPDetector.unknownHostErrorInIPOverride=Unknown host: ${error}
NodeStat.aggressiveGC=AggressiveGC modificator
NodeStat.aggressiveGCLong=Enables the user to tweak the time in between GC and forced finalization. SHOULD NOT BE CHANGED unless you know what you're doing! -1 means: disable forced call to System.gc() and System.runFinalization()
NodeStat.ignoreLocalVsRemoteBandwidthLiability=Treat local requests as remote requests for bandwidth liability limiting?
NodeStat.ignoreLocalVsRemoteBandwidthLiabilityLong=Enable this for significantly lower bandwidth usage and slightly more security against request starting timing attacks (mostly you don't need to worry about them as correlation attacks are probably easier)
NodeStat.freeHeapBytesThreshold=Free heap bytes threshold
NodeStat.freeHeapBytesThresholdLong=Freenet will try to keep it's free heap bytes above the threshold by refusing new requests
NodeStat.freeHeapPercentThreshold=Free heap percent threshold
NodeStat.freeHeapPercentThresholdLong=Freenet will try to keep it's free heap percentage (of max heap bytes allowed) above the threshold by refusing new requests
NodeStat.maxPingTime=Maximum ping time?
NodeStat.maxPingTimeLong=Freenet will reject all requests if the average ping time to its peers goes above this level. Ping times have proven a reliable indicator of both system and network load, but if your internet connection is unusually slow, you should increase this. Measured in milliseconds.
NodeStat.subMaxPingTime=Start rejecting requests at what ping time?
NodeStat.subMaxPingTimeLong=Freenet will start to reject some requests when the average ping time to its peers goes beyond this time. Increase it if your internet connection is unusually slow. Measured in milliseconds.
NodeStat.memCheck=Enable the Memory check
NodeStat.memCheckLong=Enable the memory check (writes a message in logfile, mandatory for aggressiveGCModificator to have any effect!)
NodeStat.statsPersister=File to store node statistics in
NodeStat.statsPersisterLong=File to store node statistics in (not client statistics, and these are used to decide whether to accept requests so please don't delete)
NodeStat.threadLimit=Thread limit
NodeStat.threadLimitLong=Freenet will try to limit its thread usage to the specified value, refusing new requests
NodeStats.allRequests=All requests
NodeStats.bulkSends=Bulk sends

NodeStats.pSuccess=P(Success)
NodeStats.remoteCHKs=Remote CHKs
NodeStats.remoteSSKs=Remote SSKs
NodeStats.transfersTimedOut=Transfers timed out
NodeStats.valueTooLow=This value is too low for that setting, increase it!
NodeUpdateManager.enabled=Check for, and download new versions
NodeUpdateManager.enabledLong=Should your node automatically check for new versions of Freenet. If yes, new versions will be automatically detected and downloaded, but not necessarily installed. This setting resets itself always back to false unless your Freenet node runs within the wrapper.
NodeUpdateManager.extURI=Where should Freenet look for updates to freenet-ext.jar?
NodeUpdateManager.extURILong=Where should your Freenet node look for updates to freenet-ext.jar?
NodeUpdateManager.installNewVersions=Automatically install new versions
NodeUpdateManager.installNewVersionsLong=Should your node automatically update to the newest version of Freenet, without asking?
NodeUpdateManager.invalidExtURI=Invalid ext URI: ${error}
NodeUpdateManager.invalidRevocationURI=Invalid revocation URI: ${error}
NodeUpdateManager.invalidUpdateURI=Invalid update URI: ${error}
NodeUpdateManager.noUpdateWithoutWrapper=Cannot update because not running under wrapper
NodeUpdateManager.revocationURI=Where should Freenet look for the revocation key?
NodeUpdateManager.revocationURILong=URI for the revocation key. If this is found Freenet will display its contents and disable the auto-updater.
NodeUpdateManager.updateCatastropheTitle=Catastrophic Update Failure!
NodeUpdateManager.updateFailed=Update Failed: ${reason}
NodeUpdateManager.updateFailedTitle=Update Failed!
NodeUpdateManager.updateFailedShort=Update Failed: ${reason}
NodeUpdateManager.updateSeednodes=Update the seednodes automatically?
NodeUpdateManager.updateSeednodesLong=Update the seednodes.fref file automatically over Freenet?
NodeUpdateManager.updateInstallers=Download the latest installers over Freenet?
NodeUpdateManager.updateInstallersLong=Download the latest installers over Freenet? These will be linked from the "Add a Friend" page.
NodeUpdateManager.updateURI=Where should Freenet look for updates?
NodeUpdateManager.updateURILong=Where should your Freenet node look for updates?
NotEnoughNiceLevelsUserAlert.title=Not enough Nice levels available!
NotEnoughNiceLevelsUserAlert.short=Not enough Nice levels available! Please run Freenet at a lower nice level.
NotEnoughNiceLevelsUserAlert.content=Your node has detected that it is running at a high nice level. It can't perform well if they aren't enough levels available. Please lower the nice level you're node is running at (Look for PRIORITY in the run.sh file and lower its value)! Currently your node has ${available} levels to play with whereas it would need ${required}.
OpennetManager.oneConnectionPerIP=Limit to one connection per address? (strangers)
OpennetManager.oneConnectionPerIPLong=Don't allow more than one stranger connection per address? This will make it slightly harder for an attacker to connect more than once to your node as different identities, in order to dominate your routing or make harvesting easier. Also prevents having the same node connected on as a friend and stranger simultaneously.
OpennetConnectionsToadlet.successTimeTitle=Last success
OpennetConnectionsToadlet.successTime=Last time there was a successful CHK fetch from the node
OpennetConnectionsToadlet.fullTitle=${counts} Strangers (Untrusted Peers) of ${name}
OpennetConnectionsToadlet.peersListTitle=My Opennet Peers (untrusted peers added by Freenet in low/normal network security level)
PacketSender.somePeersDisconnectedBlockedTooLong=Probably a bug: please report: ${count} peers forcibly disconnected due to blocking for a packet number for over 10 minutes.
PacketSender.somePeersDisconnectedBlockedTooLongDetail=${count} of your peers are having severe problems (failing to allocate a packet number after 10 minutes). This is probably due to a bug in the code. Please report it to us at the bug tracker at ${link}https://bugs.freenetproject.org/${/link} or to the support mailing list support@freenetproject.org. Please include this message and what version of Freenet you are running. The affected peers (you may not want to include this in your bug report if they are darknet peers) are:
PNGFilter.invalidHeader=The file you tried to fetch is not a PNG. It does not include a valid PNG header. It might be some other file format, and your browser may do something dangerous with it, therefore we have blocked it.
PNGFilter.invalidHeaderTitle=Not a PNG - invalid header
PeerManagerUserAlert.connErrorTitle=Some peers cannot connect
PeerManagerUserAlert.connError=${count} of your peers cannot connect for an unknown reason, possibly because of a buggy node or a corrupt node reference.
PeerManagerUserAlert.clockProblemTitle=Clock problem
PeerManagerUserAlert.clockProblem=${count} of your nodes are unable to connect because their system clock is more than 24 hours different to yours. Please check whether your computer has the correct time. Incorrect time will cause many node and client mechanisms to fail.
PeerManagerUserAlert.noConns=This node has not been able to connect to any other nodes so far; it will not be able to function normally. Hopefully some of your peers will connect soon; if not, try to get some more peers. You need at least 3 peers at any time, and should aim for 5-10.
PeerManagerUserAlert.noConnsTitle=No open connections
PeerManagerUserAlert.noPeersDarknet=This node has no peers to connect to, therefore it will not be able to function normally. Ideally you should connect to nodes run by people you know (if you are paranoid, then people you trust; if not, then at least people you've talked to). You need at least 3 connected peers at all times, and ideally 5-10. You could set the network security level to NORMAL or LOW to enable connecting to strangers and quickly get some connections.
PeerManagerUserAlert.noPeersTestnet=This node has no peers to connect to, therefore it will not be able to function normally. Ideally you should connect to nodes run by people you know (if you are paranoid, then people you trust; if not, then at least people you've talked to). You need at least 3 connected peers at all times, and ideally 5-10. You could set the network security level to NORMAL or LOW to enable connecting to strangers and quickly get some connections.
PeerManagerUserAlert.noPeersTitle=No peers found
PeerManagerUserAlert.oneConn=This node only has one connection. Performance will be impaired, and you have no anonymity nor even plausible deniability if that one person is malicious. Your node is attached to the network like a "leaf" and does not contribute to the network's health. Try to get at least 3 (ideally more like 5-10) connected peers at any given time.
PeerManagerUserAlert.onlyFewConnsTitle=Only ${count} open connection(s)
PeerManagerUserAlert.tooHighBwlimitDelayTime=This node has to wait too long for available bandwidth (${delay}ms > ${max}ms). Increase your output bandwidth limit and/or remove some peers to improve the situation.
PeerManagerUserAlert.tooHighBwlimitDelayTimeTitle=bwlimitDelayTime too high
PeerManagerUserAlert.tooHighPingTime=Freenet is having trouble talking with its peers quickly enough (${ping}ms > ${max}ms). Your upload bandwidth limit may be too low, in which case you should increase it, or too high, in which case you should decrease it. Normally you should not allow Freenet more than half your upload bandwidth. Also, this problem can be caused by high processor usage (by other applications or because Freenet's memory limit in wrapper.conf is too low), excessive swapping or by network problems outside of Freenet's control, or possibly by bugs in Freenet. You should try to resolve this as Freenet will work very badly until it is fixed.
PeerManagerUserAlert.tooHighPingTimeTitle=Internet connection problems: Ping time too high
PeerManagerUserAlert.tooManyConns=There are too many connections (${count} > ${max}). Adding large numbers of nodes automatically does not produce a small-world topology, hurts routing, and risks producing single points of failure.
PeerManagerUserAlert.tooManyConnsTitle=Too many open connections
PeerManagerUserAlert.tooManyDisconnected=This node has too many disconnected peers (${count} > ${max}). This will have a slight impact on your performance as disconnected peers also consume a small amount of bandwidth and CPU. Consider "cleaning up" your peer list. Note that ideally you should connect to nodes run by people you know. Even if not, adding lots of nodes automatically is bad as it does not produce an optimal topology.
PeerManagerUserAlert.tooManyDisconnectedTitle=Too many disconnected peers
PeerManagerUserAlert.tooManyNeverConnected=Many of this node's peers have never connected even once: ${count}. You should not add peers unless you know that they have also added your reference. Otherwise they will not connect.
PeerManagerUserAlert.tooManyNeverConnectedTitle=Many peers have not connected once yet
PeerManagerUserAlert.tooManyNeverConnectedWithLink=Many of this node's peers have never connected even once: ${count}. You should not add peers unless you know that they have also added ${link}your reference${/link}. Otherwise they will not connect.
PeerManagerUserAlert.tooManyPeers=This node has too many peers (${count} > ${max}). We do not recommend running ubernodes with automated addition of peers; this does not produce a small world network topology. This will also marginally impact your performance as disconnected peers consume a small amount of bandwidth and CPU. Consider "cleaning up" your peer list.
PeerManagerUserAlert.tooManyPeersTitle=Too many peers
PeerManagerUserAlert.tooOldNeverConnectedPeers=One or more of your node's peers have never connected in the two weeks since they were added.  Consider removing them since they are marginally affecting performance (wasting packets talking to nodes that aren't there).
PeerManagerUserAlert.tooOldNeverConnectedPeersTitle=Never connected peer(s) too old
PeerManagerUserAlert.twoConns=This node has only two connections. Performance and security will not be very good, and your node is not doing any routing for other nodes. Your node is embedded like a 'chain' in the network and does not contribute (much) to the network's health. Try to get at least 3 (ideally more like 5-10) connected peers at any given time.
PeersSayKeyBlownAlert.intro=One or more of your peers says that the auto-update key is blown! This means that an attacker may know the private key for the auto-update system and can therefore cause your node to run code of his choice (if you update)! The auto-update system has been disabled. It is also possible that your peers are deliberately lying about it.
PeersSayKeyBlownAlert.fetching=Your node is attempting to download the revocation certificate to find out more details.
PeersSayKeyBlownAlert.failedFetch=Your node has been unable to download the revocation certificate. Possible causes include an attack on your node to try to get you to update despite the key being blown, or your nodes lying about the key being blown. Please contact the developers or other Freenet users to sort out this mess.
PeersSayKeyBlownAlert.connectedSayBlownLabel=These connected nodes say that the key has been blown (we are trying to download the revocation cert from them):
PeersSayKeyBlownAlert.disconnectedSayBlownLabel=These nodes told us that the key has been blown, but then disconnected, so we could not fetch the revocation certificate:
PeersSayKeyBlownAlert.failedTransferSayBlownLabel=These nodes told us that the key has been blown, but then failed to transfer the revocation certificate:
PeersSayKeyBlownAlert.titleWithCount=Auto-update key blown according to ${count} peer(s)!
PeersSayKeyBlownAlert.short=According to some of your peers it is not safe to auto-update. Auto-update has been disabled until we know if they are not making it up.
PluginConfig.configFile=Plugins configuration file
PluginConfig.configFileLong=Path/Filename for the file which stores the plugin configuration
PluginConfig.installDir=Plugins installation directory
PluginConfig.installDirLong=Directory where to install the plugins
PluginJarUpdater.pluginUpdatedShortText=A new version of the ${name} plugin is available!
PluginJarUpdater.pluginUpdatedText=Click below to update to the latest version (${newVersion}) of ${name}.
PluginJarUpdater.pluginUpdatedTitle=A new version of the ${name} plugin is available!
PluginJarUpdater.updatePlugin=Update plugin after final security checks
PluginJarUpdater.willDeployAfterRevocationCheck=The plugin ${name} will be deployed as soon as we have finished double-checking that the auto-update system has not been compromised.
PluginManager.alwaysLoadPluginsFromCentralServer=Always load plugins over the web?
PluginManager.alwaysLoadPluginsFromCentralServerLong=If true, we will always load plugins over the web, and not try to fetch them from Freenet. The plugins will be downloaded from our central web server via SSL, the SSL certificate is bundled with your Freenet node.

SecurityLevels.title=Security levels
SecurityLevels.tooltip=Configure your Freenet node's degree of security
SecurityLevels.networkThreatLevelShort=Protection against a stranger attacking you over the Internet
SecurityLevels.networkThreatLevel=How much security do you need against people and organisations trying to trace what you are doing on Freenet?
SecurityLevels.networkThreatLevel.name.MAXIMUM=MAXIMUM
SecurityLevels.networkThreatLevel.name.HIGH=HIGH
SecurityLevels.networkThreatLevel.name.NORMAL=NORMAL
SecurityLevels.networkThreatLevel.name.LOW=LOW
SecurityLevels.networkThreatLevel.choice.MAXIMUM=I intend to access information that could get me arrested, imprisoned, or worse. I understand that Freenet is experimental and cannot ensure security against certain known attacks, but I accept the risks compared to the alternatives.
SecurityLevels.networkThreatLevel.desc.MAXIMUM=Freenet will be ${bold}significantly${/bold} slower than in HIGH, as well as only connecting to Friends. If an attacker can be safely assumed to be initially distant, not know whom he is targetting as real person and only know what he is tracing, and if it's expensive for him to hack and social engineer his way across the network (and if there is no glaring bug), your real identity should be safe.
SecurityLevels.networkThreatLevel.choice.HIGH=I would like to make it much more difficult for others to monitor my communications, or I am worried about ISPs and/or governments trying to block Freenet.
SecurityLevels.networkThreatLevel.desc.HIGH=Only connecting to Friends massively improves security, but Freenet will be slow unless you add at least 5-10 friends.
SecurityLevels.networkThreatLevel.choice.NORMAL=I live in a relatively free country, but I would like to make it more difficult for others to monitor my communications.
SecurityLevels.networkThreatLevel.desc.NORMAL=Freenet will be reasonably careful to protect your anonymity, at some performance cost. You should add friends running Freenet and upgrade to HIGH when you are able.
SecurityLevels.networkThreatLevel.choice.LOW=I do not care about monitoring and want maximum performance.
SecurityLevels.networkThreatLevel.desc.LOW=It may be quite easy for others to discover your identity!
SecurityLevels.networkThreatLevel.opennetIntro=Do you know personally anyone who already uses Freenet? If you know at least 3 people who already use Freenet, you can enable darknet mode, so Freenet will only connect to your Friends, greatly improving security. However, if you don't know anyone already on Freenet, or if you want maximum performance, you should enable opennet mode, and Freenet will automatically connect to other Freenet nodes run by strangers (as well as your Friends).
SecurityLevels.networkThreatLevel.opennetFriendsWarning=Adding people as Friends who you don't know outside of Freenet will not improve security and will reduce performance!
SecurityLevels.networkThreatLevel.opennetLabel=Opennet mode (connect to strangers and friends)
SecurityLevels.networkThreatLevel.opennetExplain=I don't know anyone who already uses Freenet: Connect to other Freenet nodes automatically.
SecurityLevels.networkThreatLevel.darknetLabel=Darknet mode (connect to friends only)
SecurityLevels.networkThreatLevel.darknetExplain=I know at least 3 people (10+ for good performance) who already use Freenet: Connect only to Friends.
SecurityLevels.noFriendsWarning=You have not added any Friends. If you set the network security level to high or maximum, you will be unable to connect to Freenet until you have at least one connected Friend! Note that for there to be any meaningful security benefit, these must be people you actually know and at least marginally trust, and for good performance you will need at least 5-10 of them connected at any time. Are you sure?
SecurityLevels.noFriendsCheckbox=I am sure, enable high network security level, I will add some Friends ASAP.
SecurityLevels.noConnectedFriendsWarning=You do not have any connected Friends, although you have added ${added} friends. If you set the network security level to high or maximum, you will only be able to connect to Freenet when your friends are online, which they are not at the moment. You should add additional Friends, only use Freenet when your friends are connected, or not upgrade to high security. Note that for there to be any meaningful security benefit, your Friends must be people you actually know and at least marginally trust, and for good performance you will need at least 5-10 of them connected at any time. Are you sure?
SecurityLevels.noConnectedFriendsCheckbox=I am sure, I will add more Friends and/or I accept that Freenet will only be online when my existing Friends are online.
SecurityLevels.fewConnectedFriendsWarning=You only have ${connected} connected Friends right now, and you have added ${added} friends in total. If you set the network security level to high or maximum, Freenet will only connect to your Friends, so your performance may be significantly reduced, and if all your Friends are offline then it will not be able to connect at all. Note that Friends must be people you know and at least marginally trust for there to be any real security benefit, and you will need at least 5-10 connected Friends for good performance. Are you sure?
SecurityLevels.fewConnectedFriendsCheckbox=I am sure, I will add more Friends and/or I accept the performance cost and the fact that Freenet may not connect when my Friends are offline.
SecurityLevels.networkThreatLevelLowWarning=You are about to downgrade your node's network security level to low. This means that it will be easy for strangers to attack your anonymity over the Internet. Are you sure?
SecurityLevels.networkThreatLevelLowCheckbox=I am sure, I want more speed and I don't care who can tell what I'm doing with Freenet!
SecurityLevels.networkThreatLevelConfirmTitle=WARNING: Setting network security level to ${mode}
SecurityLevels.maximumNetworkThreatLevelWarning=${bold}WARNING:${/bold} You are about to set the maximum network security level! This will ${bold}significantly${/bold} slow down Freenet for you! Please do not do this unless you really need the security!
SecurityLevels.maxSecurityYouNeedFriends=${bold}You must know at least one person already running Freenet${/bold}, preferably 3, 5-10 for good performance. You must add them on the Friends page. These must be people you already know and at least marginally trust.
SecurityLevels.maximumNetworkThreatLevelCheckbox=Yes I really want to enable maximum security, I understand that Freenet is still experimental and it may still be possible to trace me, and that this setting may dramatically reduce Freenet's performance!
SecurityLevels.physicalThreatLevelShort=Protection if your computer is seized or stolen
SecurityLevels.physicalThreatLevel=How concerned are you about people stealing or seizing your computer and being able to see what you've been doing on Freenet?
SecurityLevels.physicalThreatLevelSwapfile=We strongly recommend you encrypt your hard disk using e.g. ${truecrypt}Truecrypt${/truecrypt} and choose LOW. If you have not done this, choose a higher level, but you should turn off or encrypt your swapfile.
SecurityLevels.physicalThreatLevelSwapfileWindows=On some versions of Windows you can do this with the command "fsutil behavior set encryptpagingfile 1".
SecurityLevels.physicalThreatLevel.name.NORMAL=NORMAL
SecurityLevels.physicalThreatLevel.name.LOW=LOW
SecurityLevels.physicalThreatLevel.choice.NORMAL=I am concerned. Encrypt all important data. (Most users should choose this option)
SecurityLevels.physicalThreatLevel.desc.NORMAL=You can wipe sensitive data using the panic button or securely deleting the file master.keys. We recommend you Fetch big files rather than Download'ing them, so that they are encrypted and can be viewed through the downloads page.
SecurityLevels.physicalThreatLevel.choice.LOW=I am not concerned. Don't encrypt anything. (You can choose this option if you are already encrypting your hard disk)
SecurityLevels.physicalThreatLevel.desc.LOW=Freenet will be slightly faster but will leave traces of what you have been doing with it, including your browsing and downloads (even those you have already removed).
SecurityLevels.physicalThreatLevel.name.HIGH=HIGH
SecurityLevels.physicalThreatLevel.choice.HIGH=I am very concerned. Encrypt all important data with a password. (Choose this if you are happy to rely on a password)
SecurityLevels.physicalThreatLevel.desc.HIGH=You will have to enter the password to access your download queue (and the cache of recently visited sites). You can also use the panic button.
SecurityLevels.physicalThreatLevel.name.MAXIMUM=MAXIMUM
SecurityLevels.physicalThreatLevel.choice.MAXIMUM=I am extremely worried. Encrypt everything and do not store the key. Wipe everything, including downloads, whenever Freenet is restarted. (Freenet will not remember what you have visited between restarts, so will download stuff again; this may make you slightly more vulnerable on the network level but if you are very worried about seizure choose this option).
SecurityLevels.physicalThreatLevel.desc.MAXIMUM=Freenet will keep the encryption keys in RAM only, and will never store the keys to disk. All downloads and uploads will persist only until restart and will not be written to disk. You should take care to avoid saving content from Freenet to disk accidentally.
SecurityLevels.physicalThreatLevelEnd=You should follow standard security precautions (keep updated, run an anti-virus, don't open files you don't trust etc), and note that if they capture your computer while it is switched on and running Freenet, no amount of encryption will help you!
SecurityLevels.userAlertShortText=Security levels: Network: ${network}, Friends: ${friends}, Physical: ${physical}

SecurityLevels.enterPassword=Please enter the master password to enable access to downloads and uploads and to improve performance by enabling the recently browsed freesites cache.
SecurityLevels.setPasswordLabel=Set the password
SecurityLevels.setPassword=Please set the master password, which will be used to protect cached content. The stronger the password the stronger the protection: lots of letters and numbers and punctuation is best.
SecurityLevels.setPasswordTitle=Set the password
SecurityLevels.passwordNotZeroLength=The password must be at least one character long i.e. it must not be "".
SecurityLevels.passwordForDecryptTitle=Please enter the old password
SecurityLevels.passwordForDecrypt=In order to un-password the client cache etc, we need the old password.
SecurityLevels.cantWriteNewMasterKeysFileTitle=Unable to write the new master.keys file!
SecurityLevels.cantWriteNewMasterKeysFile=Something went wrong - maybe out of disk space or a hard disk problem. See the following error message for details:
SecurityLevels.oldPasswordLabel=Old password:
SecurityLevels.newPasswordLabel=New password:
SecurityLevels.setPasswordTitle=Set a new master password
SecurityLevels.changePasswordButton=Change password
SecurityLevels.changePasswordTitle=Change the master password
SecurityLevels.backToSecurityLevels=Don't set or change the password and return to the security levels page.
SecurityLevels.passwordFileCorruptedTitle=Master password file corrupted
SecurityLevels.passwordFileCorrupted=The master password file ${file} has been corrupted. You can delete it and lose the client-cache and the downloads and uploads queues, or you can restore it from a backup. 
SecurityLevels.wrongOldPassword=You entered the wrong old password. If you have lost the password you can remove the master.keys file to set a new password, but you will lose all the data protected by the old password - the recently visited sites cache and the download queue in particular.
SecurityLevels.cantDeletePasswordFileTitle=Unable to delete master passwords file!
SecurityLevels.cantDeletePasswordFile=Freenet was not able to delete the master passwords file ${filename}. You must securely delete it by hand, otherwise if your computer is seized the attacker will be able to decrypt your cache of recently visited sites and your downloads and uploads. Please delete ${filename} manually.
SecurityLevels.cantDeletePasswordFileButton=Try again
SecurityLevels.warningWillEncrypt=Warning: Freenet will not encrypt your downloads/uploads database (node.db4o) until you restart Freenet and enter your new password again. Until then it will remain plain-text, readable if your computer is seized or stolen.
SecurityLevels.warningWillDecrypt=Warning: Freenet will not decrypt your downloads/uploads database (node.db4o) until you restart Freenet. Until then Freenet will continue to use the encrypted node.db4o.crypt, so it will be slightly slower.
SecurityLevels.warningWontEncrypt=Warning: The downloads/uploads database (node.db4o) will not be encrypted because it is not currently encrypted and Freenet is configured to not automatically encrypt/decrypt it. So your downloads and uploads will be readable if your computer is seized or stolen.
SecurityLevels.warningWontDecrypt=Warning: The downloads/uploads database (node.db4o) will remain encrypted because Freenet is configured to not automatically encrypt/decrypt it. So Freenet will continue to use it encrypted, and will be slightly slower.

UndetectableCharsetException.title=Could not detect charset, looks like ${charset} but isn't
UndetectableCharsetException.explanation=Detected first few bytes of charset declaration but is invalid, ignoring the style sheet as per CSS 2.1 section 4.4.
UnknownContentTypeException.explanation=Your Freenet node does not know anything about the type ${type}. This means that your browser might do something dangerous in response to downloading this file. For example, many formats can contain embedded images or videos, which are downloaded from the web; this is by no means innocuous, because they can ruin your anonymity and expose your IP address (if the attacker runs the web site or has access to its logs). Hyperlinks to the Web can also be a threat, for much the same reason, as can scripting, for this and other reasons.
UnknownContentTypeException.title=Unknown and potentially dangerous content type: ${type}
