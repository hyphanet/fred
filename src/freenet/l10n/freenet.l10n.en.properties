Announcer.announceAlertIntro=Freenet is connecting to the network - this may take a few minutes. Performance will continue to improve during the next few hours. This will happen each time you shut down Freenet for more than a few minutes, so try to leave it running 24 hours a day if possible.
Announcer.announceAlertTitle=Node Announcing
Announcer.announceDetails=We have recently sent ${recentSentAnnouncements} announcements, ${runningAnnouncements} of which are still running, and added ${addedNodes} nodes (${refusedNodes} nodes have rejected us). We are currently connected to ${connectedSeednodes} seednodes and trying to connect to another ${disconnectedSeednodes}.
Announcer.announceAlertNoSeednodes=There is no seednodes.fref file found, so your Freenet node will not be able to automatically bootstrap itself onto the opennet. Please add some nodes manually, or download the seednodes file from http://downloads.freenetproject.org/alpha/opennet/ .
Announcer.announceLoading=Freenet is currently loading the seednodes file so that it can attempt to announce to the rest of the network. Announcement may take a few minutes.
Announcer.announceDisabledTooOldTitle=Announcement disabled (too old)
Announcer.announceDisabledTooOld=This node appears to be too old to connect to the current Freenet network. Your node will try to download a more recent version of Freenet from its peers and restart to update after this download finished. Please give it some time. This message will disappear when the update is finished. We have disabled announcement, since it is not getting anywhere.
Announcer.announceDisabledTooOldUpdateDisabled=To allow freenet to update itself, please enable auto-update on the ${config}Configuration page${/config}.
Announcer.announceDisabledTooOldShort=Your Freenet node has tried to connect to the network but your copy of Freenet is too old to route data. Please update!
Announcer.announceAlertShort=Freenet is trying to connect to the network, it will be slow for a while.
Announcer.coolingOff=For the next ${time} seconds, your Freenet node is waiting for the nodes that it just announced to to connect, if there are not enough nodes it will try a different node.
Announcer.dontKnowAddress=Freenet has not yet been able to determine our IP address, we cannot announce until we know what it is.

DarknetAddRefToadlet.title=Connect to a Friend
DarknetAddRefToadlet.explainBoxTitle=Why you should connect to your friends running Freenet
DarknetAddRefToadlet.explainBox1=You can improve Freenet's security by connecting to your friends. That is, to people you actually know who also run Freenet. These can be online acquaintances, but do not add connections to total strangers, as adding strangers as Friends will not improve security much and will cause problems for the network as a whole if lots of people do it. When you have added enough Friends, so that at least 5 are online at all times, you can increase your network security level to HIGH, and only connect to Friends, which is called "darknet mode". This makes it much harder for an attacker to even find out that you are running Freenet, and makes most attacks against your anonymity much harder. Freenet will make encrypted connections to your friends directly over the Internet, so only add people you can already be easily connected to (family, coworkers, real life friends, online friends).
DarknetAddRefToadlet.explainInstallerWindows=You can find the latest Windows installer in ${filename} or click ${get-windows}here${/get-windows}.
DarknetAddRefToadlet.explainInstallerWindowsNotYet=Freenet has not yet managed to download the Windows installer, however you can get it over Freenet ${link}here${/link}.
DarknetAddRefToadlet.explainInstallerNonWindows=You can find the latest non-Windows installer in ${filename} or click ${get-nonwindows}here${/get-nonwindows}. This is a jar file which must be opened with java; hopefully your friend can double click on it, but if that doesn't work try opening a command line and typing "java -jar ${shortfilename}".
DarknetAddRefToadlet.explainInstallerNonWindowsNotYet=Freenet has not yet managed to download the non-Windows installer, however you can get it over Freenet ${link}here${/link}. This is a jar file which must be opened with java; hopefully your friend can double click on it, but if that doesn't work try opening a command line and typing "java -jar ${shortfilename}".
DarknetAddRefToadlet.explainBox2=In order to connect to a Friend, you need to exchange noderefs with them. A noderef is a small file which contains the information needed for their copy of Freenet ("Freenet node") to connect to yours. You must add their noderef and they must add your noderef, for the two nodes to connect. See below for your noderef.

DarknetConnectionsToadlet.noPeersWithHomepageLink=Freenet can not work as you have not added any peers so far. Please go to the ${link}node homepage${/link} and read the top infobox to see how it is done.
DarknetConnectionsToadlet.noRefOrURL=Could not detect either a node reference or a URL. Please try again.
DarknetConnectionsToadlet.nodePortsTitle=Ports used by your Freenet node
DarknetConnectionsToadlet.notConnected=Not connected: No connection so far but this node is continuously trying to connect.
DarknetConnectionsToadlet.notConnectedShort=Disconnected
DarknetConnectionsToadlet.noTrustLevelAddingFriendTitle=You must set a trust level for your friend's node
DarknetConnectionsToadlet.noTrustLevelAddingFriend=You must set a trust level - LOW, NORMAL or HIGH. This is simply how much you trust this friend. Higher trust levels give better performance but also less security if the friend decides to attack you, e.g. to try to find out what you are doing on Freenet. If your friend is only a casual acquaintance you might want to set LOW; if you trust them completely you should set HIGH. If you know they don't look after their computer properly and constantly get viruses etc you should reduce it a bit since it might not be them you are connecting to but somebody who has broken into their computer!
DarknetConnectionsToadlet.noVisibilityLevelAddingFriendTitle=You must set a visibility level for your friend's node
DarknetConnectionsToadlet.noVisibilityLevelAddingFriend=You must set a visibility level for your friend - YES (your other friends can see them, provided they also have YES), NAME ONLY (they can see the name of the peer and offer to get connected if they know each other), or NO (your other friends cannot see this node). Making your friends visible to your friends improves performance and makes it easier to get connected both to Freenet and to people you know once you are on Freenet.
DarknetConnectionsToadlet.opennetFnpPort=Opennet FNP: ${port}/UDP (used to connect to untrusted peers i.e. Strangers; forward this port if you can)
DarknetConnectionsToadlet.pasteReference=Enter node reference directly:
DarknetConnectionsToadlet.peersEnable=Enable selected peers
DarknetConnectionsToadlet.peersDisable=Disable selected peers
DarknetConnectionsToadlet.peersSetBurstOnly=On selected peers, set BurstOnly (only set this if you have a static IP and are not NATed and neither is the peer)
DarknetConnectionsToadlet.peersClearBurstOnly=On selected peers, clear BurstOnly
DarknetConnectionsToadlet.peersSetListenOnly=On selected peers, set ListenOnly (not recommended)
DarknetConnectionsToadlet.peersClearListenOnly=On selected peers, clear ListenOnly
DarknetConnectionsToadlet.peersSetAllowLocal=On selected peers, set allowLocalAddresses (useful if you are connecting to another node on the same LAN)
DarknetConnectionsToadlet.peersClearAllowLocal=On selected peers, clear allowLocalAddresses
DarknetConnectionsToadlet.peersSetIgnoreSourcePort=On selected peers, set ignoreSourcePort (try this if behind an evil corporate firewall; otherwise not recommended)
DarknetConnectionsToadlet.peersClearIgnoreSourcePort=On selected peers, clear ignoreSourcePort
DarknetConnectionsToadlet.peersSetDontRoute=On selected peers, set dontRoute (you shouldn't use that unless you know what you're doing, really!)
DarknetConnectionsToadlet.peersClearDontRoute=On selected peers, clear dontRoute
DarknetConnectionsToadlet.peerTrustTitle=How much do you trust this friend?
DarknetConnectionsToadlet.peerTrustIntroduction=A higher trust level will improve performance for you and your friend. But this makes you more vulnerable if they are untrustworthy, or their computer is hacked or seized.
DarknetConnectionsToadlet.peerTrustExplain.LOW=I don't trust my friend. Share as little as possible. Lower performance. Note that this is still safer than connecting to strangers in almost all cases.
DarknetConnectionsToadlet.peerTrustExplain.NORMAL=I trust my friend a little. Share some information, but take some precautions. Moderate performance gain.
DarknetConnectionsToadlet.peerTrustExplain.HIGH=I trust my friend, and I trust his ability to secure his computer. Share as much information as possible to maximise performance.

DarknetConnectionsToadlet.peerTrust.NORMAL=NORMAL
DarknetConnectionsToadlet.peerTrust.HIGH=HIGH
DarknetConnectionsToadlet.peerVisibilityTitle=Do you want your other friends to be able to see and connect to this friend?
DarknetConnectionsToadlet.peerVisibilityIntroduction=If you let your friends see this friend, and this friend see your friends, it will improve performance significantly. However you might not want your other friends to know about this one (but bear in mind that anyone who can see your internet connection might be able to link you). They can also disable being seen by your friends.
DarknetConnectionsToadlet.peerVisibility.NO=NO
DarknetConnectionsToadlet.peerVisibility.YES=YES
DarknetConnectionsToadlet.peerVisibility.NAME_ONLY=NAME ONLY
DarknetConnectionsToadlet.peerVisibilityExplain.NO=Don't tell my friends about this friend, and don't let them tell their other friends about me: they are a secret contact.

DarknetConnectionsToadlet.tmciPort=TMCI: ${port}/TCP (simple telnet-based command-line interface)
DarknetConnectionsToadlet.tooNew=Connected but too new: These peers' minimum mandatory build is higher than this node's build number.
DarknetConnectionsToadlet.tooNewShort=Too new
DarknetConnectionsToadlet.tooOld=Connected but too old: This node's minimum mandatory build is higher than these peers' build numbers. This node is not routing requests to them.
DarknetConnectionsToadlet.tooOldShort=Too old
DarknetConnectionsToadlet.triedToAddSelf=You can't add your own node to the list of remote peers.

DataStoreTooSmallAlert.title=Your datastore is smaller than recommended
DataStoreTooSmallAlert.description=You are recommended to contribute at least ${size} GiB of disk space to the network. The more space everyone contributes, the more files the network can hold, and for longer times.
DataStoreTooSmallAlert.current=Your current datastore size: ${size}
DataStoreTooSmallAlert.available=Total available disk space: ${size}
DataStoreTooSmallAlert.submit=Go to datastore size configuration
DiskSpaceUserAlert.title=Please free up some disk space!

DroppedOldPeersUserAlert.droppingOldFriendFull=Freenet has dropped ${count} friend connection(s) because they haven't updated since ${buildDate}. Build ${buildNumber} included an important change to Freenet's encryption, and we cannot maintain backwards compatibility to really old nodes because older encryption protocols are vulnerable to attack. The old node references have been saved in ${filename}.
DroppedOldPeersUserAlert.droppingOldFriendList=Peers dropped:
FileInsertWizardToadlet.filterFileLabel=You can run the content filter in advance to see what the uploaded file will look like:
FileInsertWizardToadlet.insertCanonicalTitle=Insert a canonical key
FileInsertWizardToadlet.insertCanonical=This will always produce the same key for the same file, so is convenient for filesharing. However, if the bad guys can predict what files you are going to insert, they may be able to use this to trace you a lot more easily.
FileInsertWizardToadlet.insertCanonicalAdvanced=(Inserts to CHK@, with the encryption keys derived from the content)
FileInsertWizardToadlet.insertIntro=There are several different ways to upload (insert) a file to Freenet depending on whether you have uploaded the file before and what your security requirements are:
FileInsertWizardToadlet.insertRandomTitle=Insert a random, safe key
FileInsertWizardToadlet.insertRandom=This is much safer than the first option, but the key will be different every time you or somebody else inserts the key. Use this if you are the original source of some sensitive data.
FileInsertWizardToadlet.insertRandomAdvanced=(Inserts to a random SSK, with the encryption keys created randomly)
FileInsertWizardToadlet.insertSpecificKeyTitle=Specify a key
FileInsertWizardToadlet.insertSpecificKey=If you know the exact key you want to insert to, please specify it here. If it is an SSK, USK or KSK, all the data under it will be encrypted randomly as with "Insert a random, safe key".
FileInsertWizardToadlet.previewFilterFile=Filter a file

FirstTimeWizardToadlet.bandwidthCapPrompt=Does your internet connection have a monthly data limit?
FirstTimeWizardToadlet.bandwidthLimitMonthlyTitle=Monthly Data Limit
FirstTimeWizardToadlet.bandwidthLimitMonthly=Freenet can be configured to not exceed a data limit. How much data do you want to allow Freenet to use each month? Freenet may have to be very slow in order to stay under a given limit. The bandwidth limits will be set with the assumption that Freenet is always online, so actual bandwidth usage may be lower. You can adjust these limits at any time from the ${bold}${coreSettings}${/bold} page.
FirstTimeWizardToadlet.bandwidthLimitRateTitle=Transfer Rate Limit
FirstTimeWizardToadlet.bandwidthLimitRate=How fast is your Internet connection? Freenet should use no more than half of it. You can change this setting later on the ${bold}${coreSettings}${/bold} page. Note that 1 megabit per second (1 Mbps) = 125 kilobytes per second (125 KB/s).
FirstTimeWizardToadlet.bandwidthConnectionHeader=Connection type
FirstTimeWizardToadlet.bandwidthDetected=Detected speed (use half)
FirstTimeWizardToadlet.bandwidthConnectionDialUp=Dial up modem (NOT RECOMMENDED!)

FirstTimeWizardToadlet.bandwidthDownloadHeader=Download limit
FirstTimeWizardToadlet.bandwidthMonthlyLow=The requested monthly limit of ${requested} GB/month is too low. With bandwidth limits set to the minimum, Freenet may use around ${minimum} GB/month if it is always online. If Freenet isn't always online it can be set to use higher bandwidth limits. To use the minimum limits, click ${useMinimum}.
FirstTimeWizardToadlet.bandwidthMonthlyUseMinimum=Use Minimum
FirstTimeWizardToadlet.bandwidthUploadHeader=Upload limit
FirstTimeWizardToadlet.bandwidthSelect=Select
FirstTimeWizardToadlet.bandwidthPerSecond=/s
FirstTimeWizardToadlet.bandwidthMonthlyNetTransfer=Monthly Net Transfer

FirstTimeWizardToadlet.browserWarningPageTitle=Browser Security Advisory
FirstTimeWizardToadlet.browserWarningShort=You must use a separate browser (or a browser with privacy/incognito mode) for Freenet!
FirstTimeWizardToadlet.browserWarningShortRelativelySafe=You could use privacy mode or a separate browser to improve security
FirstTimeWizardToadlet.browserWarningIncognitoShort=You are using a browser with incognito mode for Freenet (this is good)
FirstTimeWizardToadlet.browserWarning=We ${bold}strongly${/bold} recommend that you do not use the same web browser to both browse the ordinary web and access Freenet, unless it is in incognito/privacy mode. Browser history stealing attacks in particular may enable malicious websites to determine which Freenet-based websites ("freesites") you have recently visited, breaking your anonymity. Please use a separate browser to access the Freenet web interface. For example, on Windows, the Browse Freenet option in the rabbit icon (in the system tray) will automatically open Google Chrome in incognito mode if it is installed.
FirstTimeWizardToadlet.browserWarningMaybeSafe=You are using a reasonably recent browser which should be relatively safe. However it will record what you browse on Freenet in its history. You could use privacy/incognito mode to prevent this. It can also be cleared manually but this will usually leave some traces.
FirstTimeWizardToadlet.browserWarningIncognito=You seem to be using a browser in privacy/incognito mode (check in the title bar). This should be relatively safe, but do not use the same browser for the web and Freenet, unless it is in privacy mode.
FirstTimeWizardToadlet.browserWarningIncognitoMaybeSafe=You seem to be using a recent browser in privacy/incognito mode (check in the title bar). This should be relatively safe. On older browsers (before Firefox 4), do not use the same browser for both the web and Freenet, unless they are in privacy mode.
FirstTimeWizardToadlet.browserWarningFirefoxMightHaveClobberedTabs=Freenet has tried to launch Firefox in privacy mode. This should prevent your browser keeping records of what you are browsing on Freenet. On some versions, it may have shut down any browser windows and tabs you already had open. You can get them back by going to the Tools menu and clicking on Stop Private Browsing. If Firefox is in privacy mode it should say so in the title bar or on a tab. If it doesn't you can open it manually in privacy mode and then open ${url}, or use a separate browser (or browser profile) just for Freenet.
FirstTimeWizardToadlet.browserWarningOldFirefox=You are using a relatively old version of Firefox (3 or earlier). Firefox 4 or later has an important privacy enhancement, the CSS history leak fix. You should upgrade if possible.
FirstTimeWizardToadlet.browserWarningOldFirefoxNewerHasPrivacyMode=Newer versions of Firefox also support privacy mode, which can be helpful.
FirstTimeWizardToadlet.browserWarningSuggestion=Most web browsers, apart from Microsoft Internet Explorer, will work adequately with Freenet, for example Firefox, Opera, Safari, Chrome, and Lynx are known to work. You should install one of these, then copy the current URL from the location bar, and open it in your new browser.
FirstTimeWizardToadlet.browserImeWarning=If you are using a thirdparty IME (Input Method Editor, used as text input for common asian languages), please disable it for Freenet and use an IME from your Operating System. There have been reports of the IME collecting your keystrokes and sending them to remote servers.
FirstTimeWizardToadlet.browserVoiceRecognitionWarning=Voice recognition has also been used for on-device surveillance.
FirstTimeWizardToadlet.browserWarningIncognitoSuggestion=Most web browsers, apart from Microsoft Internet Explorer, will work adequately with Freenet, for example Firefox, Opera, Safari, Chrome, and Lynx are known to work.
FirstTimeWizardToadlet.chooseNodeName=Node name required!
FirstTimeWizardToadlet.chooseNodeNameLong=Please enter a node name in the field below (we recommend a nickname possibly with an email address). This is so that your friends (trusted peers, which you have manually added) can easily tell your node from their other nodes. This is not visible to strangers (untrusted automatically added peers). Note that any friend or stranger may trivially identify you from your IP address, since you are connected to them, but they cannot easily tell what you are requesting.
FirstTimeWizardToadlet.connectToStrangers=Connect to strangers?
FirstTimeWizardToadlet.connectToStrangersLong=To run Freenet, you must connect to at least five other nodes.  These should ideally be run by people whom you know and trust.  If you don't know enough friends running Freenet, you can choose to connect to strangers' nodes as well.  However, connecting to strangers allows others to find out that you are using Freenet and adds some additional security risks.  If you want to keep your use of Freenet secret, this may get you into trouble.
FirstTimeWizardToadlet.enableOpennet=It is possible to turn off stranger connections later on, once you have added enough friends, although you will already have revealed some information to strangers in the meantime.  Freenet is still experimental, and we offer no guarantees about security.
FirstTimeWizardToadlet.enableUPnP=Enable Universal Plug and Play (UPnP). Set this if you have a router on your local network. Don't set it if you are directly connected to your ISP e.g. via dial-up modem, or have untrusted people on your local network (e.g. some student accomodation).
FirstTimeWizardToadlet.opennetYes=I want Freenet to automatically find strangers to connect to.
FirstTimeWizardToadlet.opennetNo=I have at least 5 friends already using Freenet and I will add their details on the Friends page.
FirstTimeWizardToadlet.bandwidthLimit=Bandwidth Limits
FirstTimeWizardToadlet.continue=Continue
FirstTimeWizardToadlet.currentPrefix=Current size:
FirstTimeWizardToadlet.currentSpeed=Current limit:
FirstTimeWizardToadlet.datastoreSize=Datastore size
FirstTimeWizardToadlet.datastoreSizeLong=Please select a size for your datastore. Recommended values lie between 1GiB and 20GiB. A smaller datastore can result in problems downloading files, a larger datastore is beneficial to the network but might slow down your computer due to high filesystem load, especially in the first few hours after installation. The datastore acts like a cache; storing data for the network will help you to get better throughput when requesting popular files. The more space you can afford the better it is for the community and the faster your node and especially your downloads will go.
FirstTimeWizardToadlet.enableAutoUpdater=Enable auto updater on first startup?
FirstTimeWizardToadlet.enableAutoUpdaterLong=Whether to enable the auto updater on first startup. This can be disabled by custom configurations for environments in which auto updating is not available.
FirstTimeWizardToadlet.highNetworkThreatLevelWarning=${bold}PLEASE NOTE:${/bold} In high security mode, Freenet only connects to your Friends. Your Friends are people you trust whom you have added through the ${bold}${addAFriend}${/bold} page in the ${bold}${friends}${/bold} menu. In high security mode Freenet will not function until you have added at least one Friend, and you should add at least 3 - preferably 5 to 10 - for better performance. Freenet cannot hide connections made to others, only what is transferred through them. Do not connect to anyone you do not trust or would not want to be publicly linked to in real life.
FirstTimeWizardToadlet.highNetworkThreatLevelCheckbox=I trust at least one person already using Freenet, and I will add them through the ${bold}${addAFriend}${/bold} page.
FirstTimeWizardToadlet.isNetworkTrusted=Is your local network trusted?
FirstTimeWizardToadlet.isNetworkTrustedLong=Is your local network trusted? If you answer yes here all the services provided by your node will be wide open to everyone willing to access them on the given network. You will be able to do selective access controls from the configuration page when the wizard is over.
FirstTimeWizardToadlet.noNetworkIF=No additional network interface found
FirstTimeWizardToadlet.noNetworkIFLong=Freenet hasn't found any additional network interface. It will assume that you will connect to it from your computer and only from it.
FirstTimeWizardToadlet.iDoTrust=Do you trust people connected to ${interface} (${ip})?
FirstTimeWizardToadlet.loadUPnPPlugin=Load the UPnP plugin on first startup?
FirstTimeWizardToadlet.loadUPnPPluginLong=Whether to load the UPnP plugin on first startup. This can be disabled by custom configurations for environments in which UPnP routers are not available.
FirstTimeWizardToadlet.memory.64M=64MiB - only if desperate
FirstTimeWizardToadlet.memory.128M=128MiB - bare minimum
FirstTimeWizardToadlet.memory.192M=192MiB - reasonable default
FirstTimeWizardToadlet.memory.256M=256MiB - if you have at least 1GiB of RAM
FirstTimeWizardToadlet.memory.512M=512MiB - if you have lots of RAM
FirstTimeWizardToadlet.memoryLimit=Memory usage
FirstTimeWizardToadlet.memoryLimitLong=How much memory would you like to allow Freenet to use? If you have many downloads or uploads queued, Freenet will need more memory. We suggest you not set this below 128MiB unless you are really short of RAM. If you have 1GiB or more, you should probably set this to at least 256MiB. This will take effect after restarting Freenet.
FirstTimeWizardToadlet.networkThreatLevelConfirmTitle.HIGH=Add friends or Freenet cannot connect!
FirstTimeWizardToadlet.networkThreatLevelConfirmTitle.MAXIMUM=Add friends or Freenet cannot connect!
FirstTimeWizardToadlet.networkThreatLevelIntroOpennet=Freenet will connect to strangers, so security will be relatively low. You can add friends later if you want. How concerned are you about people you don't know trying to trace you?
FirstTimeWizardToadlet.networkThreatLevelIntroDarknet=Freenet will only connect to your friends, making it very difficult for anyone to trace your Freenet usage. How concerned are you about people you don't know trying to trace you?
FirstTimeWizardToadlet.networkThreatLevelHeaderOpennet=Protection against a stranger attacking you over the internet (connect to strangers)
FirstTimeWizardToadlet.networkThreatLevelHeaderDarknet=Protection against a stranger attacking you over the internet (only connect to friends)
FirstTimeWizardToadlet.networkSecurityPageTitle=Network Security
FirstTimeWizardToadlet.networkSecurityIKnowSomeoneWhoRunsFreenet=I know someone who runs Freenet.
FirstTimeWizardToadlet.networkSecurityFreenetWillConnectToStrangers=Freenet will connect to strangers. You can always add connections to trusted friends later to improve security.
FirstTimeWizardToadlet.networkSecurityIWantToConnectToUntrustedStrangers=I want to connect to untrusted strangers to improve performance.
FirstTimeWizardToadlet.opennetChoicePageTitle=Who should Freenet connect to?
FirstTimeWizardToadlet.opennetChoiceTitle=Who should Freenet connect to?
FirstTimeWizardToadlet.opennetChoiceIntroduction=Freenet is designed to prevent your chat messages, downloads, browsing etc from being traced back to you. Freenet can only provide strong protection when you know the people you are directly connected to.
FirstTimeWizardToadlet.opennetChoiceConnectFriends=Only connect to your friends
FirstTimeWizardToadlet.opennetChoiceConnectStrangers=Connect to strangers
FirstTimeWizardToadlet.opennetChoiceConnectFriendsPRO=Very hard to trace anything on Freenet back to you.
FirstTimeWizardToadlet.opennetChoiceConnectFriendsCON=You need at least ${minfriends} friends that use Freenet.
FirstTimeWizardToadlet.opennetChoiceConnectStrangersPRO=No need to know anyone that uses Freenet.
FirstTimeWizardToadlet.opennetChoiceConnectStrangersCON=Much easier to trace your messages, files, etc back to you.
FirstTimeWizardToadlet.opennetChoiceHowSafeIsFreenetToggle=Freenet provides reasonable anonymity and is very hard to block, IF: (touch to see)
FirstTimeWizardToadlet.opennetChoiceHowSafeIsFreenetStupid=You don't do anything that could reveal your identity, e.g. use your real name, post your home address on a chat board or talk about people you know personally. Other personally identifying information includes common sense stuff like where you went to school but also your IP address, your Freenet port numbers, and in some cases your Freenet logs and statistics. If you have a problem with Freenet you should usually make a new identity before asking for help.
FirstTimeWizardToadlet.opennetChoiceHowSafeIsFreenetFriends=You only connect to your friends.
FirstTimeWizardToadlet.opennetChoiceHowSafeIsFreenetTrustworthy=Your friends are trustworthy (but strangers are always worse than friends).
FirstTimeWizardToadlet.opennetChoiceHowSafeIsFreenetNoSuspect=Possible attackers don't already know or suspect who or where you are: they only know you are a particular identity on Freenet.
FirstTimeWizardToadlet.opennetChoiceHowSafeIsFreenetChangeID=You change your anonymous identity occasionally (e.g. on forums).
FirstTimeWizardToadlet.opennetChoiceHowSafeIsFreenetSSK=You always upload files safely. Freenet will remind you how to do this.
FirstTimeWizardToadlet.opennetChoiceHowSafeIsFreenetOS=Your friends keep their computers secure.
FirstTimeWizardToadlet.opennetChoiceHowSafeIsFreenetBigPriv=You are part of a big network (e.g. the main Freenet which you get if enabling connecting to strangers) or part of a private network which the attackers do not know about.
FirstTimeWizardToadlet.opennetChoiceHowSafeIsFreenetDistant=You are not too close to strangers. If for instance your friends connect to strangers, you may not be safe against a very powerful attacker. Most people shouldn't worry too much about this, it will improve as your friends connect their friends and no longer need strangers.
FirstTimeWizardToadlet.opennetChoiceHowSafeIsFreenetBugs=There aren't any horrible bugs in Freenet. Every program of reasonable size contains bugs. We hope no serious ones which would affect your anonymity are left in freenet, but we might have missed them. You have been warned!
FirstTimeWizardToadlet.opennetChoiceHowSafeIsFreenetFoot2=For now you probably want to connect to strangers just to get connected. However, a determined attacker may be able to trace your uploads/downloads/chat/etc back to you, so don't do this if you are planning to upload dangerous content. In the long term we hope everyone will connect only to their friends as this is much safer.
FirstTimeWizardToadlet.opennetChoicePro=Advantage
FirstTimeWizardToadlet.opennetChoiceCon=Disadvantage
FirstTimeWizardToadlet.friendsSecurityPageTitle=Security With Friends
FirstTimeWizardToadlet.physicalSecurityPageTitle=Physical Security
FirstTimeWizardToadlet.plugins=Plugins
FirstTimeWizardToadlet.pluginsLong=Plugins are optional extensions to Freenet that enhance it in some way. Some of them may have security issues for some users, see below.
FirstTimeWizardToadlet.presetTitleLow=Connect to any Freenet user: (low security)
FirstTimeWizardToadlet.presetChooseLow=Choose low security
FirstTimeWizardToadlet.presetLow=If you live in a relatively free country where running Freenet is legal, you can choose this option. It is much safer than traditional P2P software like BitTorrent or Gnutella, but an attacker with moderate resources may be able to trace your activity on Freenet back to you. If you have friends who also run Freenet, you can improve security by adding them as Friends, then connecting only to them.
FirstTimeWizardToadlet.presetTitleHigh=Connect only to friends: (high security)
FirstTimeWizardToadlet.presetChooseHigh=Choose high security
FirstTimeWizardToadlet.presetHigh=If you know several people you want to connect to, this setting allows you to create your own Freenet darknet for vastly improved security. If you only have a few people it may not be very useful, but if some of them know others, or have low security set, you can have a very large network.
FirstTimeWizardToadlet.presetTitleNone=Detailed settings: (custom)
FirstTimeWizardToadlet.presetNone=If you want more fine-grained control, this option lets you set up Freenet according to your own privacy needs. It will take a bit longer than the other two options.

FetchException.longError.15=A node was overloaded or timed out
FetchException.longError.16=Too many redirects - loop?
FetchException.longError.17=Internal error, probably a bug
FetchException.longError.18=Found the file, but lost it while receiving the data
FetchException.longError.19=Splitfile error
FetchException.longError.1=Too many levels of recursion into archives
FetchException.longError.20=Invalid URI
FetchException.longError.21=Too big

FetchException.longError.27=Permanent redirect: use the new URI
FetchException.longError.28=Some of the data was found, but not enough to fetch the key.
FetchException.longError.29=Wrong content type: The key was not in the list of allowed content types provided by the client
FetchException.longError.2=Don't know what to do with splitfile
FetchException.longError.30=The request was terminated by a node because it had recently received a request for the same key and that request had failed
FetchException.longError.31=The page (or file) appears to be corrupt, but might be dangerous; you should not open this page unless you know what you are doing. Normally Freenet can filter pages of this type, but this page is so broken that we are unable to make it safe. If you open it anyway it won't be filtered, so it may give away your IP address.
FetchException.longError.32=The data is of an unknown type which might be dangerous
FetchException.longError.33=The data is of a type known to be dangerous, so the content filter has stopped the request
FetchException.longError.34=The hashes in the metadata do not match the actual data. The data may have been corrupted during download, or it may have been broken when it was inserted for example if the node inserting was broken or the data changed on disk mid-insert.
FetchException.longError.35=Splitfile decoding produced a data block that wasn't in the original list of keys. It is likely that the insert was corrupted, but it is possible that this is a bug or hardware failure on your computer.
FetchException.longError.36=The file claims to have a safe MIME type but is being downloaded to disk with a file extension not compatible with that type. For example, "virus.exe" claiming to be a text file would trigger this error. This might just be a bad filename, but it might be a malicious file trying to get past the content filter.
FetchException.longError.37=There is not enough disk space to start a download or to start the next stage of a download. Please free up some disk space and restart the request.
FetchException.longError.3=Don't know what to do with metadata
FetchException.longError.4=Failed to parse metadata
FetchException.longError.5=Failure in extracting files from an archive

InsertFreesiteToadlet.title=Upload a freesite
InsertFreesiteToadlet.content1=You can anonymously upload a web site to Freenet ("insert a Freesite"). Once it has been uploaded, it will remain on Freenet for as long as people continue to access it occasionally. It is distributed across the network and therefore also available if your computer is turned off. And the most important fact: If the security level of Freenet has been configured properly it should be very difficult to find out who has uploaded a Freesite.
InsertFreesiteToadlet.contentFlogHelper=If you just want to create a simple blog, we recommend you use FlogHelper. You can load this on the ${plugins}plugins page${/plugins}, and then use it from the menu.
InsertFreesiteToadlet.content2=If you want to upload a website you have mirrored from somewhere, or something larger or more complex, you will need a tool called jSite. Get version ${jsite-freenet-version} ${jsite-freenet}from Freenet${/jsite-freenet} (${jsite-info}more information${/jsite-info}).
InsertFreesiteToadlet.content3=Once you have downloaded jSite, and constructed your website using an HTML editor such as KompoZer (free), work through one of the following tutorials which are hosted on Freenet:
InsertFreesiteToadlet.contentThingamablog=Alternatively, Thingamablog is a user-friendly blog generator, you can download a Freenet-compatible version ${thingamablog}here${/thingamablog} or ${thingamablog-freenet}over Freenet${/thingamablog-freenet}.

IPUndetectedUserAlert.loadDetectPlugins=No IP detection plugins are currently loaded. Please go to the ${plugins}Plugins page${/plugins} and load the UPnP plugin.
IPUndetectedUserAlert.loadJSTUN=You could load the JSTUN plugin on the ${plugins}Plugins page${/plugins}, but please read the warnings about it first as it may not be safe.
IPUndetectedUserAlert.noIPMaybeFromPeers=Freenet should be able to detect it from your ${number} friends, but they may be offline or not port forwarded.
IPUndetectedUserAlert.noDetectorPlugins=Freenet is unable to detect your IP address! Please load the UPnP plugin!
IPUndetectedUserAlert.unknownAddress=Freenet was unable to determine your external IP address (or the IP address of your router or Firewall). You can still exchange references with your friends, however this may not always work if your friend is behind a router or firewall. As soon as you have connected to one other user in this way, Freenet will be able to determine your external IP address. You can determine your current IP address and tell your node with the 'Temporary IP address hint' on the config page. Alternatively if you have a static IP address or domain name, please tell Freenet about it using the "IP address override" option.
IPUndetectedUserAlert.unknownAddressTitle=Unknown external address
IPUndetectedUserAlert.unknownAddressWithConfigLink=Freenet was unable to determine your external IP address (or the IP address of your router or firewall). You can still exchange references with your friends, however this may not always work if your friend is behind a router or firewall. As soon as you have connected to one other user in this way, Freenet will be able to determine your external IP address. You can determine your current IP address and tell your node with the 'Temporary IP address hint' on ${link}the config page${/link}, or enter it below. Alternatively if you have a static IP address or domain name, please tell Freenet about it using the "IP address override" option.
IPUndetectedUserAlert.unknownAddressShort=Freenet was unable to determine your IP address. You may have problems connecting.
IPUndetectedUserAlert.suggestForwardPort=Also, it would be a good idea to forward the port ${port} (UDP) on your router to make it easier to connect to your node.
IPUndetectedUserAlert.suggestForwardTwoPorts=Also, it would be a good idea to forward the ports ${port1} and ${port2} (UDP) on your router to make it easier to connect to your node.

InvalidAddressOverrideUserAlert.unknownAddress=Freenet has determined that the currently configured ipAddressOverride value is invalid, meaning that it does not match the syntax for a valid hostname, IPv4 address or IPv6 address (in the opinion of the current implementation of the function that checks the IPv6 address syntax).
InvalidAddressOverrideUserAlert.unknownAddressTitle=Invalid Address Override Value
InvalidAddressOverrideUserAlert.unknownAddressWithConfigLink=Freenet has determined that the currently configured ipAddressOverride value is invalid, meaning that it does not match the syntax for a valid hostname, IPv4 address or IPv6 address (in the opinion of the current implementation of the function that checks the IPv6 address syntax). You can correct the 'IP address override' ${link}configuration parameter${/link}.
InvalidAddressOverrideUserAlert.unknownAddressShort=Your ipAddressOverride is bogus. Please fix it.
IntOption.parseError=The value specified can't be parsed as a 32-bit integer : ${val}
JavaEOLAlert.body=Your Java version ${current} is at its "End Of Life" and is no longer receiving updates to fix security problems. Freenet will require version ${new} or higher in a future update, so it will stop working with this one. Please upgrade your Java installation.
JavaEOLAlert.title=Freenet will stop working with your outdated Java version
JPEGFilter.notJpeg=The file you tried to fetch is not a JPEG. It might be some other file format, and your browser may do something dangerous with it, therefore we have blocked it.
KnownUnsafeContentTypeException.dangerousInlines=This type of content can contain inline images or videos, and can therefore load content from the non-anonymous open Web, exposing your IP address.
KnownUnsafeContentTypeException.dangerousInlinesLabel=Dangerous inlines:
KnownUnsafeContentTypeException.dangerousLinks=This type of content can contain links to the non-anonymous Web; if you click on them (and they may be disguised), this may expose your IP address.
KnownUnsafeContentTypeException.dangerousLinksLabel=Dangerous links:
KnownUnsafeContentTypeException.dangerousMetadata=This type of content can contain metadata which may be displayed by some browsers or other software, which may contain dangerous links or inlines.
KnownUnsafeContentTypeException.dangerousMetadataLabel=Dangerous metadata:
KnownUnsafeContentTypeException.dangerousScripts=This type of content can contain dangerous scripts which when executed may compromise your anonymity by connecting to the open Web or otherwise breach security.
KnownUnsafeContentTypeException.dangerousScriptsLabel=Dangerous scripting:
KnownUnsafeContentTypeException.knownUnsafe=This is a potentially dangerous content type. If Freenet lets it through, your browser may do bad things leading to compromise of your anonymity, and your IP address being exposed in connection with this page. In particular:
KnownUnsafeContentTypeException.noFilter=Since there is no built-in filter for this data, you should take the utmost of care!
KnownUnsafeContentTypeException.title=Known dangerous type: ${type}

LogConfigHandler.minLoggingPriorityLong=Minimum priority at which messages are logged. Options are debug, minor, normal, warning, error, in order of diminishing verbosity. Generally you only need to change this if something is broken and you need to gather more information for the developers. If you are worried about your computer being seized, set this to ERROR to minimise any possible information leakage.
LogConfigHandler.rotationInterval=Log rotation interval
LogConfigHandler.rotationIntervalLong=Log rotation interval - period after which logs are rotated. We keep the last two log files (current and prev), plus lots of compressed logfiles up to maxZippedLogsSize

LongOption.parseError=The value specified can't be parsed as a 64-bit integer : ${val}
MainJarUpdater.ConfirmMultiFileUpdater.title.wrapper-update-unix=Please update the wrapper files
MainJarUpdater.ConfirmMultiFileUpdater.text.wrapper-update-unix=Freenet has downloaded an update to the Java Service Wrapper binaries. These are a set of files involved in running and updating Freenet. Updating these files may fix some important bugs especially on Linux/FreeBSD, particularly a bug that often causes Freenet to restart repeatedly after an update. We strongly recommend that you allow Freenet to update these files as soon as is convenient.
MeaningfulNodeNameUserAlert.noNodeNick=Please set a name for your node so that your friends can identify your node, e.g. if you send them a message or a file. This will only be visible to your Friends who you manually connect to via the Add a Friend page, and possibly to their Friends. Your node's nickname will not be visible to strangers, that is, Freenet connections added automatically in the lower security levels.
MeaningfulNodeNameUserAlert.noNodeNickTitle=Please set a name for your Freenet node.
MeaningfulNodeNameUserAlert.noNodeNickShort=Please set a name for your Freenet node.
MP3Filter.bogusMP3NoFrames=Doesn't look like an MP3.
MP3Filter.bogusMP3NoFramesExplanation=This does not look like an MP3 file. It might be corrupt or somebody might be trying to mask some other kind of (potentially dangerous) file as an mp3 file to breach your anonymity.
MP3Filter.freeBitrateNotSupported=Free format bitstream MP3 files not supported by filter
MP3Filter.freeBitrateNotSupportedExplanation=The file appears to be an mp3 file with the "freeformat" bitstream extension, which allows non-standard bitrates. These are not supported by most players and so are relatively rare. Nonetheless the file is probably safe if you are careful and your player doesn't do silly things, like rendering web URLs as links.

N2NTMUserAlert.headerShort=Message from ${from}
N2NTMUserAlert.reply=Reply
N2NTMUserAlert.title=Node to Node Text Message ${number} from ${peername} (${peer})
Node.acceptSeedConnectionsShort=Be a seednode?
Node.acceptSeedConnections=If true, the node will accept connections from new insecure-mode nodes and help to bootstrap them onto the network. This allows any node with your noderef to connect, but only for purposes of announcement: it can only do requests to nodes that it gets through the announcement (possibly including this node if we don't have many Strangers).
Node.alwaysAllowLocalAddresses=Always allow connecting to nodes via local addresses?
Node.alwaysAllowLocalAddressesLong=If true, Freenet will attempt to connect to other nodes via their local (localhost, LAN) addresses as well as their public IPs. If this is not set, you can still enable it for specific darknet peers (but not opennet peers). Set this if you want to connect to other nodes on the same LAN or computer, and don't mind that bogus references can cause your node to send UDP packets to machines on your LAN.
Node.assumeNATed=Assume the port is not forwarded.
Node.assumeNATedLong=Should Freenet assume the port is NATed and not forwarded, and always send handshakes aggressively (every 10-30 seconds), regardless of any evidence to the contrary?
Node.bandwidthLimitMustBePositiveOrMinusOne=Download bandwidth limit must be positive or -1.
Node.bandwidthMinimum=The requested bandwidth limit of ${limit} bytes/second is too low. Bandwidth limits must be at least ${minimum} bytes/second because lower limits than this cannot properly connect to the network.
Node.bindTo=IP address to bind to
Node.bindToLong=IP address to bind to
Node.bwlimitMustBePositive=Upload bandwidth limit must be positive.
Node.cachingFreenetStoreMaxSize=Maximum size of the in-memory write cache for each store (there are 9 such stores).
Node.cachingFreenetStoreMaxSizeLong=Maximum size of the in-memory write cache for each store (there are 9 such stores). 0 for no in-memory cache (e.g. if you have a solid-state disk). Keys are of various sizes, so e.g. if the limit is between 2K and 32K it will only be used for storing small keys (SSKs and public keys).
Node.cachingFreenetStorePeriod=Maximum time blocks will be kept in the in-memory datastore cache before being written to the store on disk (in milliseconds).
Node.clientCacheType=Client cache type?
Node.clientCacheTypeLong=If you set this to none there will be less evidence if your computer is seized, but your node will need to re-fetch every page you visit every time you visit it, reducing performance and making your requests more visible on the network; if you set it to ram, cached pages will only be remembered until shutting down this Freenet node and will take up RAM; the first-time wizard sets it to salt-hash, which stores visited freesites on disk, but encrypted and possibly passworded according to the physical security level (so securely deleting master.keys will wipe the client cache).
Node.clientCacheSize=Client cache size (bytes, MB, GB, TB, etc)
Node.clientCacheSizeLong=Set the size of the client cache. This is used to cache freesites you visit so that they won't need to be requested next time, and therefore will load faster and won't be visible on the network. If the client cache type is "none", this option is ignored; if it is "ram", this option is the size in RAM of the client cache (part of the overall maximum memory limit, so increase that if you need to); if it is "salt-hash", this option is the size of the client-cache on disk.
Node.connectToSeednodesCannotBeChangedMustDisableOpennetOrReboot=Connect to seednodes setting: Cannot disable while opennet is running, either disable and then re-enable opennet or restart Freenet.
Node.databaseMemory=Datastore maximum memory usage (OBSOLETE: bdbje-index only!)
Node.databaseMemoryLong=Only valid with bdbje-index datastore type. Maximum memory usage of the database backing the datastore indexes, 0 means no limit (limited to ~ 30% of maximum memory)
Node.deadlockTitle=Deadlocking likely due to buggy JVM/kernel combination
Node.defragDatabaseOnStartup=Defragment the downloads database during the next startup?
Node.defragDatabaseOnStartupLong=If true, the database will be defragmented during the next startup (or after the password is entered).
Node.defragOnce=Defrag once only (set above option as well!)
Node.defragOnceLong=If this and the above option is true, we will defragment on the next startup and then turn off the defragment option.
Node.disablePHTLS=Disable probabilistic HTL
Node.disablePHTLSLong=Disable probabilistic HTL (don't touch this unless you know what you are doing)
Node.dropPacketEvery=Testing packet drop frequency
Node.dropPacketEveryLong=Frequency of dropping packets. Testing option used by devs to simulate packet loss. 0 means never artificially drop a packet. Don't touch this!
Node.enableARKs=Enable ARKs? (DON'T TURN THIS OFF!)
Node.enableARKsLong=Enable ARKs? (DON'T TURN THIS OFF!).
Node.enableOpennetFailedTitle=Enabling opennet failed
Node.enableOpennetFailed=Freenet failed to enable opennet, and cannot connect to strangers. You will need to fix this, report a bug, or stick with connecting only to Friends. Details: ${message}
Node.enableNewLoadManagementRT=Enable new load management (for realtime requests)? (EXPERIMENTAL!)
Node.enableNewLoadManagementRTLong=Turn this on to test the new load management code for realtime requests. This is highly experimental and may severely break your node or dramatically reduce or increase its performance! Good luck, and tell us what happens!
Node.enableNewLoadManagementBulk=Enable new load management (for bulk requests)? (EXPERIMENTAL!)
Node.enableNewLoadManagementBulkLong=Turn this on to test the new load management code for bulk requests. This is highly experimental and may severely break your node or dramatically reduce or increase its performance! Good luck, and tell us what happens!
Node.enablePacketCoalescing=Enable packet coalescing?
Node.enablePacketCoalescingLong=Enable packet coalescing? Packet coalescing increases bandwidth efficiency, reduces CPU usage and gains some resistance to traffic analysis at a small cost in message latency. Don't turn this off unless you know what you're doing.
Node.enablePerNodeFailureTables=Enable per-node failure tables?
Node.enablePerNodeFailureTablesLong=Enable automatically rerouting around nodes that failed a request within the last 10 minutes?
Node.enableRoutedPing=Enable FNPRoutedPing?
Node.enableRoutedPingLong=Enable FNPRoutedPing? Only useful in simulations, not on the real network. Turn it off.
Node.enableDiagnostics=Enable Diagnostics?
Node.enableDiagnosticsLong=By enabling Diagnostics the node will keep detailed information of its inner-workings (such as CPU usage per thread) which can help to troubleshoot problems. The collected data is kept in memory (i.e. not persisted on disk) and it's not sent to anybody over the network.
Node.enableSwapping=Enable location swapping?
Node.enableSwappingLong=Enable location swapping?
Node.enableSwapQueueing=Enable queueing of swap requests?
Node.enableSwapQueueingLong=Enable queueing of swap requests?
Node.enableULPRDataPropagation=Enable ULPR data propagation?
Node.enableULPRDataPropagationLong=Enable fast propagation of recently requested keys to those nodes which have asked for them when the data is eventually found? (Ultra-Lightweight Persistent Requests; this is particularly important for chat clients). This also enables RecentlyFailed, which will squash requests which have recently failed.
Node.errorApplyingConfig=Error while applying the new config : ${error}
Node.forceBigShrink=Do large store shrinks immediately (bdbje-index store type only)
Node.forceBigShrinkLong=Whether to do large store shrinks (over 10%) immediately (rather than waiting for the next node restart). Online shrinks do not preserve the most recently used data, so this is not recommended; use it only if you must have an immediate result. Specific to bdbje-index store type.
Node.inBWLimit=Download bandwidth limit
Node.inBWLimitLong=Download bandwidth limit. Freenet will try not to exceed this, but it is not very accurate. If set to -1 the download bandwidth limit will be 4x the upload bandwidth limit. Without units this is in bytes/second, and SI and IEC units are accepted, so things like 10 KiB/s or 1.5 Mbps (meaning 10 kibibytes/sec and 1.5 megabits/sec respectively) are okay.
Node.amountOfDataToCheckCompressionRatio=Amount of data to check compression ratio
Node.amountOfDataToCheckCompressionRatioLong=The data amount after compression of which we will check whether we have got the desired effect.
Node.minimumCompressionPercentage=Minimum compression percentage
Node.minimumCompressionPercentageLong=The minimal desired compression effect, %.
Node.connectionSpeedDetection=Offer upgrade of the connection speed
Node.connectionSpeedDetectionLong=Offer upgrade of the connection speed if auto-detected speed is much higher than the set speed
Node.invalidStoreSize=Store size must be at least 32MB
Node.invalidMinStoreSize=Store size must be at least 32MB
Node.invalidMinStoreSizeWithCaches=Store size must be at least 40MB
Node.invalidMaxStoreSize=Storage limit should be no more than ${maxStoreSize} GiB
Node.invalidMemoryCacheSize=Memory cache size must be at least 0. We won't actually cache any keys unless it is at least ~ 1200 bytes, and we won't cache CHKs unless it is ~ 33KB.
Node.l10nLanguage=The language Freenet will use to display messages
Node.l10nLanguageLong=This setting will change the language used to display messages.
Node.masterKeyFile=Location of the master keys file
Node.masterKeyFileLong=Filename for the master keys file. This contains the encryption keys for the cache of recently visited sites (client-cache), the download queue etc. These may be passworded through the security levels page, but securely deleting the keys file will make elements encrypted with it useless even with the password. (If this is a relative path, it will be taken relative to the user data directory.)
Node.maxHTL=Maximum HTL
Node.maxHTLLong=Maximum HTL
Node.maxOpennetPeers=Maximum number of Opennet peers
Node.maxOpennetPeersLong=Maximum number of Opennet peers (must be between 0 and ${default} inclusive, the actual limit will depend on the number of Friends and your bandwidth limit, and will be shown on the statistics page).
Node.maxOpennetPeersMustBeTwentyOrLess=Must be ${maxpeers} or less
Node.mustBePositive=Config value must be positive
Node.nodeDir=Node-reference directory
Node.nodeDirLong=Path of directory for node-related information (e.g. node identity, peers).
Node.outputBwlimitMustBeLessThan=Upload limit must be less than ${max} bytes/second.
Node.cfgDir=Config directory
Node.cfgDirLong=Path of directory for user-editable config (e.g. language overrides).
Node.userDir=User data directory
Node.userDirLong=Path of directory for user data (e.g. bookmarks, download lists).
Node.runDir=Run-time state directory
Node.runDirLong=Path of directory for run-time state. This can be cleared out when Freenet is not running.
Node.pluginDir=Plugin directory
Node.pluginDirLong=Path of directory for plugins.
Node.probeBandwidthShort=Respond to probe requests for bandwidth limit
Node.probeBandwidthLong=If true Freenet will respond to requests for the outgoing bandwidth limit. This is to improve knowledge of network conditions and allow simulations to better reflect the actual network. It will add a small amount of random noise to make the information less identifiable but still useful for diagnostics. If false it will respond with a refusal.
Node.probeBuildShort=Respond to probe requests for build
Node.probeBuildLong=If true Freenet will respond to probe requests for the build. This is to measure update propagation. If false it will respond with a refusal.
Node.probeIdentifierShort=Randomly assigned identifier for probe requests
Node.probeIdentifierLong=This identifier is only used in probe requests for an identifier. If set to -1 it will select a new random value.
Node.probeRespondIdentifierShort=Respond to probe requests for an identifier
Node.probeRespondIdentifierLong=If true Freenet will respond to probe requests for an identifier and very low-precision uptime information. It will add a small amount of random noise to the uptime information to make it less identifiable but still useful for diagnostics. This is useful for estimations of network size and churn. If false it will respond with a refusal.
Node.probeLinkLengthsShort=Respond to probe requests for link lengths
Node.probeLinkLengthsLong=If true Freenet will respond to probe requests for link lengths. This is to improve knowledge of network conditions, and allow simulations to better reflect the actual network. It will add a small amount of random noise to make the information less identifiable but still useful for diagnostics. If false it will respond with a refusal.
Node.probeLocationShort=Respond to probe requests for location
Node.probeLocationLong=If true Freenet will respond to probe requests for low-precision location. This is to allow measurement of the network location distribution, and contains no information other than location. If false it will respond with a refusal.
Node.peersOffersDismissed=Dismiss peers' offers
Node.peersOffersDismissedLong=Do not check *.fref files in a peers-offers/ folder, don't ask user whether to connect to them.
Node.datastoreTooSmallDismissed=Dismiss datastore too small alert
Node.datastoreTooSmallDismissedLong=The version at which the datastore too small user alert was last dismissed. Do not show user alert again while running this version.
Node.respondOverallBulkOutputCapacityUsage=Respond to probe requests for overall capacity usage and very approximate bandwidth limit
Node.respondOverallBulkOutputCapacityUsageLong=If true Freenet will respond to probe requests for the overall capacity usage (bandwidth liability, this is a guesstimate of how much bandwidth would be used if all running requests succeeded), and a rough idea of the bandwidth limit (as an integer, divided by 10KB/s, min 1 max 10).
Node.probeStoreSizeShort=Respond to probe requests for store size
Node.probeStoreSizeLong=If true freenet will respond to probe requests for store size. This is to improve knowledge of network conditions, and allow simulations to better reflect the actual network. It will add a small amount of random noise to make the information less identifiable but still useful for diagnostics. If false it will respond with a refusal.
Node.probeUptimeShort=Respond to probe requests for uptime
Node.probeUptimeLong=If true freenet will respond to probe requests for 48-hour or 7-day uptime percentage. This is to improve knowledge of network conditions, and allow simulations to better reflect the actual network. It will add a small amount of random noise to make the information less identifiable but still useful for diagnostics. If false it will respond with a refusal.
Node.probeRejectStatsShort=Respond to probe requests for proportion of requests of various kinds rejected.
Node.probeRejectStatsLong=If true, Freenet will respond to probe requests for the proportion of various kinds of requests which are being rejected.
Node.trafficClass=The TrafficClass value to pass to Socket.setTrafficClass() for both darknet and opennet.
Node.trafficClassLong=The TrafficClass value to pass to Socket.setTrafficClass() for both darknet and opennet. The value set won't be taken into account until the node restarts.
Node.nodeName=Nickname for this Freenet node
Node.nodeNameLong=Node nickname. This will be visible to your friends only.
Node.maxPacketSize=Maximum packet size (aka MTU)
Node.maxPacketSizeLong=Maximum size of the UDP packets Freenet sends, assuming UDP/IP headers are 48 bytes (to accommodate IPv6). We will use the MTU of the interface if we can detect it, but mostly obstructions happen elsewhere, and unfortunately we cannot easily detect the path MTU. If you are using IPv6, you are more likely to run into issues if you choose values >1400 because IPv6 will not fragment packets, but drops them instead. 1280 is a safe value.
Node.notUsingWrapperTitle=Not using the wrapper!
Node.notUsingWrapper=You are running Freenet without the wrapper. This is not recommended. Freenet will not be able to restart itself, so auto-updating won't work, and if Java crashes, it won't get restarted either. Also Freenet can't generate stack dumps in some places so debugging will be marginally harder.
Node.notUsingWrapperShort=Freenet is running without the wrapper. This is not recommended.
Node.oneConnectionPerIP=Limit to one connection per address? (friends) (NOT RECOMMENDED)
Node.oneConnectionPerIPLong=Automatically drop friend connections when other friends have the same (external) IP address.
Node.opennetEnabled=Enable insecure mode (automatically connect to untrusted nodes)?
Node.opennetEnabledLong=Enable insecure mode (aka opennet)? If this is enabled, your Freenet node will automatically exchange node references with other untrusted nodes (Strangers as opposed to Friends). But this means that the fact that you are running a node is no longer private, and many attacks are much easier. If you know enough people running Freenet, you should stick to trusted (Friends) connections to them, and turn this off.
Node.outBWLimit=Upload bandwidth limit
Node.outBWLimitLong=Hard upload bandwidth limit. Freenet should almost never exceed this. Normally you should set this to no more than half your internet connection's upload bandwidth, which is usually much less than your download bandwidth. Without units this is in bytes/second, and SI and IEC units are accepted, so things like 10 KiB/s or 1.5 Mbps (meaning 10 kibibytes/sec and 1.5 megabits/sec respectively) are okay.
Node.paddDataPackets=Pad data packets sent by this Freenet node with random data of random length? (READ WARNING BEFORE TURNING OFF!)
Node.paddDataPacketsLong=Pad data packets sent by this Freenet node with random-length content? For security, on a single node, turning this off is bad; if a large part of the network starts doing it, we become very vulnerable to a passive attacker. However, it should improve performance, particularly the payload percentage. You have been warned!
Node.passOpennetPeersThroughDarknet=Relay opennet noderefs through darknet peers?
Node.passOpennetPeersThroughDarknetLong=If true, opennet noderefs (NEVER our own darknet noderef) will be relayed through our darknet peers. So a node (this node, or its peers) can get opennet peers from its darknet peers. This is useful because it allows us to bootstrap new opennet peers after having lost our peers due to downtime, for example. However, it may make traffic analysis slightly easier, so turn it off if you are paranoid.
Node.port=Darknet port number (UDP)
Node.portLong=UDP port used by Freenet to communicate with your Friends' nodes. This port should be forwarded in your router if possible. We use a separate port for connections to Strangers.
Node.opennetPort=Opennet port number (UDP)
Node.opennetPortLong=UDP port used by Freenet to communicate with Strangers i.e. freenet nodes running in opennet mode. This port should be forwarded in your router if possible. We use a separate port for connections to your Friends' nodes.
Node.publishOurPeersLocation=Shall we send our peers' locations to our peers?
Node.publishOurPeersLocationLong=Shall we send our peers' locations to our peers? Doing so helps routing but gives some information away to a potential attacker.
Node.pleaseSetPeersVisibilityAlertTitle=Please set the visibility mode for your friends
Node.pleaseSetPeersVisibilityAlert=Freenet can now connect to your friends' friends in order to improve performance and make your connection more reliable, but it needs to know which of your peers it is safe to do this with. Please go to the Connections to Friends page and set the visibility mode for your friends. You should generally set them to YES so that Freenet can connect to their friends and they can connect to your friends, but if you don't want your friends to know about a friend set it to NO.
Node.showFriendsVisibilityAlert=Show an alert when friends' visibility settings are missing?
Node.routeAccordingToOurPeersLocation=Shall we take the locations of the peers of our peers into account for routing purposes?
Node.routeAccordingToOurPeersLocationLong=Doing so helps routing but might help a potential attacker.
Node.skipWrapperWarning=Skip "not using the wrapper" warning?
Node.skipWrapperWarningLong=If true, the "not using the wrapper" warning will not be shown. Note that this will only hide the warning from the next restart on.
Node.slashdotCacheLifetime=How long to keep data in the recent requests cache?
Node.slashdotCacheLifetimeLong=How long to keep data in the recent requests cache (milliseconds, use k for seconds)? Note that this goes away on restart anyway.
Node.slashdotCacheSize=Maximum size of the recent requests cache (in bytes, KB MB GB TB etc)
Node.slashdotCacheSizeLong=Maximum size of the recent requests cache (note that there is also a time limit).
Node.storeDirectory=Store directory
Node.storeDirectoryLong=Path of directory for the datastore files, which holds data (keys, blocks, etc) served to other freenet users.
Node.storeMaxMemTooHigh=Giving more than 80% of your ram to BDB is probably not what you want to do!
Node.storePreallocate=Preallocate space for datastore
Node.storePreallocateLong=Preallocate space for datastore
Node.storeSaltHashResizeOnStart=Resize store on node start (salt-hash only)
Node.storeSaltHashResizeOnStartLong=Resize store on node start (salt-hash only). If this is true, Freenet will complete resizing the datastore during startup. This will complete much faster than doing it "on the fly", but on the other hand your Freenet node will not be available for some time while it completes the resize.
Node.storeSize=Freenet datastore size (bytes, MB, GB, TB, etc)
Node.storeSizeLong=Size of the Freenet datastore, which includes the store and cache, and stores data passing through your node. Freenet uses disk space for many other things, such as temporary files and your downloads, which are separate.
Node.storeType=Datastore type
Node.storeTypeLong=Datastore type. Currently this can be salt-hash (this is the default, stores data on disk with a lossy hashtable and a Bloom filter), or ram (FOR TESTING ONLY, keep the index and the data in memory, not on disk). Only use ram if you know what you are doing and have enough RAM to store all your data (and note it will not be saved on shutdown)! Changes will not take effect until Freenet has been restarted.
Node.storeBloomFilterSize=Bloom filter size (total) in bytes
Node.storeBloomFilterSizeLong=Bloom filter size (total) in bytes. Usually 1/2048th the size of data store is more than enough. Set this to zero to disable bloom filter. Set this to -1 to reset to default.
Node.storeBloomFilterCounting=Use counting bloom filter?
Node.storeBloomFilterCountingLong=Use 2-bit counting bloom filter? (don't touch this unless you know what you are doing)
Node.storeUseSlotFilters=Use slot filters? (Strongly recommended)
Node.storeUseSlotFiltersLong=This greatly reduces disk I/O for the salted-hash store, at a memory and disk cost of around 4 bytes for every key i.e. 1/3000th of the store size. This is strongly recommended, unless your RAM is small and you have a fast SSD.
Node.storeSaltHashSlotFilterPersistenceTime=Persistence interval for slot filters
Node.storeSaltHashSlotFilterPersistenceTimeLong=How often should the slot filters be written for the store? -1 = write immediately. 0 = write at shutdown. >0 = write every n milliseconds. So e.g. 60000 = every minute. Note that if Freenet is shut down uncleanly, and this is not set to write immediately, the slot filter will be rebuilt on the next start-up, which will cause a significant amount of disk access.
Node.slotFilterPersistenceTimeError=Slot filter persistence time must be -1, 0, or positive.
Node.swapRInterval=Swap request send interval (ms)
Node.swapRIntervalLong=Interval in milliseconds between sending swap requests.
Node.throttleLocalTraffic=Throttle local traffic?
Node.throttleLocalTrafficLong=Throttle local traffic? If enabled, even LAN and localhost traffic will be subject to bandwidth limiting.
Node.useSlashdotCache=Cache all requests for 30 minutes?
Node.useSlashdotCacheLong=Replies to requests with high HTL are not eligible to be stored in the datastore. If this option is true, they will be stored in the recent requests cache, a special short-term cache. If this option is false then only ULPR responses (i.e. delayed answers to requests) will be stored in this cache. This is enabled by default unless network security level is MAXIMUM, as it is important for performance when a key becomes popular suddenly. However, it does have some security impact, in that if an attacker can get close to the target within 30 minutes (unlikely in most cases), this mechanism may help him to confirm his guesses.
Node.usingGCJTitle=Running Freenet under GCJ is not recommended
Node.usingGCJ=You are running Freenet under GCJ (a free Java compiler). This is buggy and likely to cause problems. We recommend switching to OpenJDK (which is also free, and less likely to have odd bugs).
Node.usingOracleTitle=You are running Freenet under the official Oracle Java Virtual Machine. Please switch to OpenJDK if possible.
Node.usingOracle=You are running Freenet under the official Oracle Java Virtual Machine. The official JVM has deliberately crippled encryption code because of export restrictions, so we have to use the built-in Freenet encryption code, which may be slower. You should switch to OpenJDK if possible (e.g. install it through your package manager).
Node.withAnnouncement=Allow Freenet to bootstrap itself using seednodes?
Node.withAnnouncementLong=Allow your Freenet node to bootstrap itself using seednodes? To get onto the opennet (the Strangers network, automatic Freenet connection on low/normal network security level), we contact public nodes chosen from a small list shipped with Freenet. Obviously this is somewhat insecure, but if you are using opennet, you probably need it: if your node is down for a while, especially if it is NATed and/or changes its IP address, it will probably need to reseed. If you want better security, you need to connect to your friends and enable high network security.
Node.writeLocalToDatastore=Write local and nearby requests to the datastore?
Node.writeLocalToDatastoreLong=Whether to write data returned by high HTL (local and nearby) requests to the main persistent datastore. We strongly recommend you keep this option disabled unless you don't care about either datastore seizure or store probing attacks.
NodeClientCore.alwaysCommit=Commit after every database job?
NodeClientCore.alwaysCommitLong=If this option is false, we commit the database to disk every 30 seconds. If it is true we commit it after every database job. This will reduce performance but will ensure that no progress is lost on an unclean shutdown, and slightly reduce memory usage. Normally this should be false, to reduce disk access.
NodeClientCore.maxArchiveSize=Maximum size of any given archive
NodeClientCore.maxArchiveSizeLong=Maximum size of any given archive
NodeClientCore.couldNotFindOrCreateDir=Could not find or create directory
NodeClientCore.downloadAllowedDirs=Directories downloading is allowed to

If this is set to "all" any user with access to FCP can download any file to anywhere on your computer!
NodeClientCore.downloadsDir=Default download directory
NodeClientCore.downloadsDirLong=The directory to save downloaded files into by default
NodeClientCore.encryptPersistentTempBuckets=Encrypt the persistent temporary buckets?

NodeClientCore.encryptTempBuckets=Encrypt the temporary buckets?
NodeClientCore.encryptTempBucketsLong=Encrypt the temporary buckets? In some cases (if you use hard-drive and swap encryption) it might not make sense to encrypt temporary buckets.
NodeClientCore.fileForClientStats=File to store client statistics in
NodeClientCore.fileForClientStatsLong=File to store client throttling statistics in (used to decide how often to send requests)
NodeClientCore.lazyStartDatastoreChecker=Start the datastore checker thread on demand?
NodeClientCore.lazyStartDatastoreCheckerLong=Start the datastore checker thread on demand? Useful mainly for simulations, or if threads are extremely costly. Most nodes should have this turned off.
NodeClientCore.lazyStartDatastoreCheckerMustRestartNode=You must restart Freenet to change the "start the datastore checker on demand" setting.
NodeClientCore.maxUSKFetchers=Maximum number of temporary  USK fetchers
NodeClientCore.maxUSKFetchersLong=Maximum number of temporary background fetches for recently visited USKs (e.g. freesites). Note that clients and plugins (e.g. WebOfTrust) can subscribe to USKs, which does not count towards the limit.
NodeClientCore.maxUSKFetchersMustBeGreaterThanZero=Must be greater than zero
NodeClientCore.memoryLimitedJobThreadLimit=Max FEC threads
NodeClientCore.memoryLimitedJobThreadLimitLong=Maximum number of threads used for memory-intensive operations such as FEC decoding/encoding (i.e. decoding a big file from blocks downloaded from the network using Forward Error Correction).
NodeClientCore.memoryLimitedJobThreadLimitMustBe1Plus=You must allow FEC decodes at least 1 thread
NodeClientCore.memoryLimitedJobMemoryLimit=Max memory used for FEC threads
NodeClientCore.memoryLimitedJobMemoryLimitLong=Maximum amount of memory used for memory-intensive operations such as FEC decoding/encoding (i.e. decoding a big file from blocks downloaded from the network using Forward Error Correction).
NodeClientCore.memoryLimitedJobMemoryLimitMustBeAtLeast=FEC decodes need at least ${min} memory (as a single large segment will need this much memory to decode/encode)
NodeClientCore.minDiskFreeLongTerm=Minimum free disk space 
NodeClientCore.minDiskFreeLongTermLong=Minimum amount of free disk space over the long term. RAM buckets for downloads in progress are counted toward this limit.
NodeClientCore.minDiskFreeShortTerm=Minimum free disk space during decode 
NodeClientCore.minDiskFreeShortTermLong=Minimum free disk space over a brief period, when doing disk-intensive but short-lived operations such as finishing a download. We recommend that this is smaller than the long-term limit.
NodeClientCore.movingTempDirOnTheFlyNotSupported=Moving temp directory on the fly not supported at present
NodeClientCore.persistentTempDir=Persistent temp files directory
NodeClientCore.persistentTempDirLong=Path of directory to put persistent temp files in. Persistent means that this should be kept even when Freenet is not running.
NodeClientCore.pluginStoresDir=Plugin data folder
NodeClientCore.pluginStoresDirLong=Path to directory to store plugins' data in. Note that not all plugins use this mechanism, some create their own files.
NodeClientCore.maxRAMBucketSize=Maximum size of a RAMBucket (bytes, KB MB etc allowed)
NodeClientCore.maxRAMBucketSizeLong=Maximum size of a RAMBucket (bigger buckets will be kept as files on the disk)
NodeClientCore.ramBucketPoolSize=Amount of RAM to dedicate to temporary buckets (bytes, KB MB etc allowed)
NodeClientCore.ramBucketPoolSizeLong=Amount of RAM to dedicate to temporary buckets. The tradeoff is more memory usage against more IOs.
NodeClientCore.startingUpTitle=Freenet is starting up
NodeClientCore.startingUp=Please allow Freenet a few moments to complete the startup process, in the meantime some things may not work and Freenet may be slower than usual.
NodeClientCore.startingUpShort=Freenet is starting up, some things may not work and it may be slow.
NodeClientCore.tempDir=Temp files directory. This can be cleared out when Freenet is not running.
NodeClientCore.tempDirLong=Name of directory to put temporary files in
NodeClientCore.uploadAllowedDirs=Directories uploading is allowed from
NodeClientCore.uploadAllowedDirsLong=Semicolon separated list of directories from which uploading is allowed. Empty means no uploading from disk allowed, "all" means uploading from anywhere (including system files etc!) is allowed. WARNING! If this is set to "all" any file on your computer can be uploaded by any user with access to FCP.
NodeClientCore.useAIMDsRT=Use AIMDs for real-time requests? (EXPERTS ONLY)
NodeClientCore.useAIMDsRTLong=Enable originator-level throttling of request starters based on TCP-style Additive Increase Multiplicative Decrease rate estimation (for realtime requests). This enables or disables a key part of the old load management system. EXPERTS ONLY!!!
NodeClientCore.useAIMDsBulk=Use AIMDs for bulk requests? (EXPERTS ONLY)
NodeClientCore.useAIMDsBulkLong=Enable originator-level throttling of request starters based on TCP-style Additive Increase Multiplicative Decrease rate estimation (for bulk requests). This enables or disables a key part of the old load management system. EXPERTS ONLY!!!
NodeIPDectector.inclLocalAddress=Include local addresses in noderef
NodeIPDectector.inclLocalAddressLong=Whether to include local addresses (LAN and localhost) in node references. This will not be useful unless the both sides set allowLocalAddresses=true for the respective references (use the Friends page in advanced mode to set this flag).
NodeIPDectector.ipOverride=IP address override
NodeIPDectector.ipOverrideLong=IP address override (not usually needed) - set this if you have a *static* IP address or a domain name (e.g. via dyndns), and you are behind a firewall. Note that Freenet will still include other detected IP addresses unless you use the "bind to" option.
NodeIPDectector.tempAddressHint=Temporary IP address hint
NodeIPDectector.tempAddressHintLong=Temporary hint to what our IP might be; deleted after use
NodeIPDetector.allowBindToLocalhost=Assume localhost to be routable
NodeIPDetector.allowBindToLocalhostLong=This feature is needed if you use other applications that provides a reachable address and proxies that to localhost. Currently this node has no way to guess those kind of addresses and add them to your physical.udp line, and there might be no other peers that can reach certain types of addresses.
NodeIPDetector.maybeSymmetric=It looks like your node may be behind a symmetric NAT. You may have connection problems: If you are behind a symmetric NAT you will probably only be able to connect to peers which are open to the internet.
NodeIPDetector.maybeSymmetricTitle=Connection problems
NodeIPDetector.maybeSymmetricShort=Connection problems: You may be behind a symmetric NAT.
NodeIPDetector.unknownHostErrorInIPOverride=Unknown host: ${error}
NodeStat.aggressiveGC=AggressiveGC modificator
NodeStat.aggressiveGCLong=Allows the user to tweak the time in between GC and forced finalization. SHOULD NOT BE CHANGED unless you know what you're doing! -1 means: disable forced call to System.gc() and System.runFinalization()
NodeStat.ignoreLocalVsRemoteBandwidthLiability=Treat local requests as remote requests for bandwidth liability limiting?
NodeStat.ignoreLocalVsRemoteBandwidthLiabilityLong=Enable this for significantly lower bandwidth usage and slightly more security against request starting timing attacks (mostly you don't need to worry about them as correlation attacks are probably easier)
NodeStat.freeHeapBytesThreshold=Free heap bytes threshold
NodeStat.freeHeapBytesThresholdLong=Freenet will try to keep its free heap bytes above the threshold by refusing new requests
NodeStat.freeHeapPercentThreshold=Free heap percent threshold
NodeStat.freeHeapPercentThresholdLong=Freenet will try to keep its free heap percentage (of max heap bytes allowed) above the threshold by refusing new requests
NodeStat.maxPingTime=Maximum ping time?
NodeStat.maxPingTimeLong=Freenet will reject all requests if the average ping time to its peers goes above this level. Ping times have proven a reliable indicator of both system and network load, but if your internet connection is unusually slow, you should increase this. Measured in milliseconds.
NodeStat.subMaxPingTime=Start rejecting requests at what ping time?
NodeStat.subMaxPingTimeLong=Freenet will start to reject some requests when the average ping time to its peers goes beyond this time. Increase it if your internet connection is unusually slow. Measured in milliseconds.
NodeStat.memCheck=Enable the Memory check
NodeStat.memCheckLong=Enable the memory check (writes a message in logfile, mandatory for aggressiveGCModificator to have any effect!)
NodeStat.statsPersister=File to store node statistics in
NodeStat.statsPersisterLong=File to store node statistics in (not client statistics, and these are used to decide whether to accept requests so please don't delete)
NodeStat.threadLimit=Thread limit
NodeStat.threadLimitLong=Freenet will try to limit its thread usage to the specified value by refusing new requests when it is using too many threads.
NodeStats.allRequests=All requests
NodeStats.averageHeader=Average
NodeStats.bulkSends=Bulk sends
NodeStats.blockTransfersRT=Block transfers (RT)

NodeStats.successfulHeader=Successful
NodeStats.timeoutFractions=Timeouts in queueing
NodeStats.transfersTimedOut=Transfers timed out
NodeStats.unsuccessfulHeader=Unsuccessful
NodeStats.valueTooLow=This value is too low for that setting, increase it!
MainJarUpdater.fetchingDependencies=Fetching jars required by the new build
MainJarUpdater.fetchingFromUOM=Fetching directly from a more up to date node ("Update Over Mandatory")
NodeUpdateManager.enabled=Check for, and download new versions
NodeUpdateManager.enabledLong=Should your node automatically check for new versions of Freenet. If yes, new versions will be automatically detected and downloaded, but not necessarily installed. This setting resets itself always back to false unless your Freenet node runs within the wrapper.
NodeUpdateManager.installNewVersions=Automatically install new versions
NodeUpdateManager.installNewVersionsLong=Should your node automatically update to the newest version of Freenet, without asking?
NodeUpdateManager.invalidRevocationURI=Invalid revocation URI: ${error}
NodeUpdateManager.invalidUpdateURI=Invalid update URI: ${error}
NodeUpdateManager.noUpdateWithoutWrapper=Cannot update because not running under the Java Service Wrapper
NodeUpdateManager.revocationURI=Where should Freenet look for the revocation key?
NodeUpdateManager.revocationURILong=URI for the revocation key. If this is found it means the auto-update system has been compromised, and Freenet will display its contents and disable the auto-updater.
NodeUpdateManager.updateCatastropheTitle=Catastrophic Update Failure!
NodeUpdateManager.updateFailed=Update Failed: ${reason}
NodeUpdateManager.updateFailedTitle=Update Failed!
NodeUpdateManager.updateFailedShort=Update Failed: ${reason}
NodeUpdateManager.updateSeednodes=Update the seednodes automatically?
NodeUpdateManager.updateSeednodesLong=Update the seednodes.fref file automatically over Freenet?

NodeUpdateManager.updateInstallersLong=Download the latest installers over Freenet? These will be linked from the "Add a Friend" page.
NodeUpdateManager.updateURI=Where should Freenet look for updates?
NodeUpdateManager.updateURILong=Where should your Freenet node look for updates? This should be a Freenet URI where updates can be downloaded from. The default URI ends in /jar/(version number). To download the source code for an update, you can copy the key below, and change "jar" to "update-source". Similarly, "changelog" gives you the user-facing list of changes, "fullchangelog" gives you the long, developer-friendly list of changes, and "installer", "wininstaller", "seednodes" and "iptocountryv4" give other files.
NodeUpdateManager.updateURIMustBeAUSK=Update URI must be a USK!
NodeUpdateManager.updateURIMustHaveNoMetaStrings=Update URI must not have extra path components, e.g. USK@blah,blah,blah/update/1430 not USK@blah,blah,blah/update/1430/
NodeUpdateManager.updateFailedInternalError=FAILED TO UPDATE FREENET. INTERNAL ERROR: ${reason}
NotEnoughNiceLevelsUserAlert.title=Not enough Nice levels available!
NotEnoughNiceLevelsUserAlert.short=Not enough Nice levels available! Please run Freenet at a lower nice level.
NotEnoughNiceLevelsUserAlert.content=Your node has detected that it is running at a high nice level. It can't perform well if they aren't enough levels available. Please lower the nice level you're node is running at (Look for PRIORITY in the run.sh file and lower its value)! Currently your node has ${available} levels to play with whereas it would need ${required}.
M3UFilter.notM3u=The file you tried to fetch is not an M3U file or it is invalid. It might be some other file format, and your browser may do something dangerous with it, therefore we have blocked it.
OpennetManager.oneConnectionPerIP=Limit to one connection per address? (strangers)
OpennetManager.oneConnectionPerIPLong=Don't allow more than one stranger connection per address? This will make it slightly harder for an attacker to connect more than once to your node as different identities, in order to dominate your routing or make harvesting easier. Also prevents having the same node connected on as a friend and stranger simultaneously.
OpennetConnectionsToadlet.successTimeTitle=Last success
OpennetConnectionsToadlet.successTime=Last time there was a successful CHK fetch from the node
OpennetConnectionsToadlet.fullTitle=${counts} Strangers (Untrusted Peers)
OpennetConnectionsToadlet.peersListTitle=My Opennet Peers (untrusted peers added by Freenet in low/normal network security level)
OggBitstreamFilter.MalformedTitle=Malformed Ogg Bitstream
OggBitstreamFilter.MalformedMessage=The Ogg bitstream is not correctly formatted, and could not be properly validated.
OggPage.ValidSubpageTitle=Ogg Page has Valid Subpage 
OggPage.ValidSubpageMessage=An element in the Ogg bitstream was found to contain another valid element. This is not a feature of any currently supported bitstream formats. It is likely the bitstream has been maliciously altered in an attempt to bypass the content filter. If this is the case, this file is dangerous, and should not be opened.
OggFilter.EmptyOutputTitle=No Valid Ogg Bitstreams
OggFilter.EmptyOutputDescription=The ContentFilter was unable to find any bitstreams in the file which could be safely validated.
PNGFilter.invalidHeader=The file you tried to fetch is not a PNG. It does not include a valid PNG header. It might be some other file format, and your browser may do something dangerous with it, therefore we have blocked it.
PNGFilter.invalidHeaderTitle=Not a PNG - invalid header
PeerManagerUserAlert.connErrorTitle=Some peers cannot connect
PeerManagerUserAlert.connError=${count} of your peers cannot connect for an unknown reason, possibly because of a buggy node or a corrupt node reference.
PeerManagerUserAlert.clockProblemTitle=Clock problem
PeerManagerUserAlert.clockProblem=${count} of your nodes are unable to connect because their system clock is more than 24 hours different to yours. Please check whether your computer has the correct time. Incorrect time will cause many node and client mechanisms to fail.
PeerManagerUserAlert.noConns=This node has not been able to connect to any other nodes so far; it will not be able to function normally. Hopefully some of your peers will connect soon; if not, try to get some more peers. You need at least 3 peers at any time, and should aim for 5-10.
PeerManagerUserAlert.noConnsTitle=No open connections
PeerManagerUserAlert.noPeersDarknet=Your Freenet node has no friends to connect to, therefore it will not be able to work normally. You need at least 3 connected friends at all times, and ideally 5-10. These should be people you know who also run Freenet. Alternatively you could set the network security level to NORMAL or LOW to enable connecting to strangers and quickly get some connections.
PeerManagerUserAlert.noPeersTitle=No friends found
PeerManagerUserAlert.oneConn=This node only has one connection. Performance will be impaired, and you have no anonymity nor even plausible deniability if that one person is malicious. Your node is attached to the network like a "leaf" and does not contribute to the network's health. Try to get at least 3 (ideally more like 5-10) connected peers at any given time.
PeerManagerUserAlert.onlyFewConnsTitle=Only ${count} open connection(s)
PeerManagerUserAlert.outdatedUpdateTitle=Freenet needs updating! Please turn on the updater on the "auto-update" configuration page.
PeerManagerUserAlert.outdatedUpdate=Freenet appears to be out of date, and may not work correctly until it is updated. Freenet can update itself automatically by downloading the update from other Freenet nodes but this is currently turned off. You should turn on the updater on the "Auto-update" configuration page. It may take an hour or two for the update to work after that. As a last resort you can use the update.sh or update.cmd script, but this is not recommended, and is less secure.
PeerManagerUserAlert.tooHighBwlimitDelayTime=This node has to wait too long for available bandwidth (${delay}ms > ${max}ms). Increase your output bandwidth limit and/or remove some peers to improve the situation.
PeerManagerUserAlert.tooHighBwlimitDelayTimeTitle=bwlimitDelayTime too high
PeerManagerUserAlert.tooHighPingTime=Freenet is having trouble talking with its peers quickly enough (${ping}ms > ${max}ms). Your upload bandwidth limit may be too low, in which case you should increase it, or too high, in which case you should decrease it. Normally you should not allow Freenet more than half your upload bandwidth. Also, this problem can be caused by high processor usage (by other applications or because Freenet's memory limit in wrapper.conf is too low), excessive swapping or by network problems outside of Freenet's control, or possibly by bugs in Freenet. You should try to resolve this as Freenet will work very badly until it is fixed.
PeerManagerUserAlert.tooHighPingTimeTitle=Internet connection problems: Ping time too high
PeerManagerUserAlert.tooManyConns=There are too many connections (${count} > ${max}). Adding large numbers of nodes automatically does not produce a small-world topology, hurts routing, and risks producing single points of failure.
PeerManagerUserAlert.tooManyConnsTitle=Too many open connections
PeerManagerUserAlert.tooManyDisconnected=This node has too many disconnected peers (${count} > ${max}). This will have a slight impact on your performance as disconnected peers also consume a small amount of bandwidth and CPU. Consider "cleaning up" your peer list. Note that ideally you should connect to nodes run by people you know. Even if not, adding lots of nodes automatically is bad as it does not produce an optimal topology.
PeerManagerUserAlert.tooManyDisconnectedTitle=Too many disconnected peers
PeerManagerUserAlert.tooManyNeverConnected=Many of this node's peers have never connected even once: ${count}. You should not add peers unless you know that they have also added your reference. Otherwise they will not connect.
PeerManagerUserAlert.tooManyNeverConnectedTitle=Many peers have not connected once yet
PeerManagerUserAlert.tooManyNeverConnectedWithLink=Many of this node's peers have never connected even once: ${count}. You should not add peers unless you know that they have also added ${link}your reference${/link}. Otherwise they will not connect.
PeerManagerUserAlert.tooOldNeverConnectedPeers=One or more of your node's peers have never connected in the two weeks since they were added.  Consider removing them since they are marginally affecting performance (wasting packets talking to nodes that aren't there).
PeerManagerUserAlert.tooOldNeverConnectedPeersTitle=Never connected peer(s) too old
PeerManagerUserAlert.twoConns=This node has only two connections. Performance and security will not be very good, and your node is not doing any routing for other nodes. Your node is embedded like a 'chain' in the network and does not contribute (much) to the network's health. Try to get at least 3 (ideally more like 5-10) connected peers at any given time.
PeersOffersUserAlert.title=Connect to a trusted peer added by you
PeersOffersUserAlert.text=Would you like to connect to this peer(s) added by you to 'peers-offers' folder?
PeersSayKeyBlownAlert.intro=One or more of your peers says that the auto-update system has been compromised! This means that an attacker may know the private key for the auto-update system and can therefore cause your node to run code of his choice (if you update)! The auto-update system has been disabled to prevent this. It is also possible that your peers are deliberately lying about it.
PeersSayKeyBlownAlert.fetching=Your node is attempting to download the revocation certificate to find out more details.
PeersSayKeyBlownAlert.failedFetch=Your node has been unable to download the revocation certificate. Possible causes include an attack on your node to try to get you to update despite the key being compromised, or your nodes lying about the key being compromised. Please contact the developers or other Freenet users to sort out this mess.
PeersSayKeyBlownAlert.connectedSayBlownLabel=These connected nodes say that the auto-update key has been compromised (we are trying to download the revocation certificate from them):
PeersSayKeyBlownAlert.disconnectedSayBlownLabel=These nodes told us that the auto-update key has been compromised, but then disconnected, so we could not fetch the revocation certificate:
PeersSayKeyBlownAlert.failedTransferSayBlownLabel=These nodes told us that the auto-update key has been compromised, but then failed to transfer the revocation certificate:
PeersSayKeyBlownAlert.titleWithCount=Auto-update key compromised according to ${count} peer(s)!
PeersSayKeyBlownAlert.short=According to some of your peers it is not safe to auto-update. Auto-update has been disabled until we know if they are lying.

PluginJarUpdater.pluginUpdatedTitle=A new version of the ${name} plugin is available!
PluginJarUpdater.updatePlugin=Update plugin after final security checks
PluginJarUpdater.willDeployAfterRevocationCheck=The plugin ${name} will be deployed as soon as we have finished double-checking that the auto-update system has not been compromised.
PluginManager.alwaysLoadPluginsFromCentralServer=Always load plugins over the web? (NOT RECOMMENDED!)
PluginManager.alwaysLoadPluginsFromCentralServerLong=If true, always download plugins over the web from our web server rather than over Freenet. This is more reliable but dangerous: While we use SSL, wiretappers may still be able to identify which plugin you download, and correlate it with when a new identity is created e.g. on Freemail; certainly they could tell you use Freenet.
PluginManager.cannotSetOnceLoaded=Cannot set the plugins list once loaded
PluginManager.deleteFailedPluginButton=Don't try again on next startup
PluginManager.loadedOnStartup=Plugins to load on startup
PluginManager.loadedOnStartupLong=Classpath, name and location for plugins to load when node starts up
PluginManager.loadedPlugins=Plugins to load on start up
PluginManager.loadedPluginsLong=A list of plugins that are started when Freenet starts

PluginManager.changePluginManagerEnabledInConfig=You must shut down Freenet and edit freenet.ini to change the plugins enabled setting. Add a line "pluginmanager.enabled=false" to disable plugin support, or "pluginmanager.enabled=true" to enable it.
PluginManager.enabled=Enable plugins?
PluginManager.enabledLong=Enable plugins? This should be enabled for nearly all nodes, but can be disabled for simulations.
PluginManager.pluginDesc.Freemail=Old version (v0.1) of email over Freenet. Requires an email client (e.g. Thunderbird). The only reason to install this is if you want to talk to people using the old Freemail, since the new Freemail isn't compatible with the old Freemail. Note that you can have both loaded at the same time as they use different ports to talk to your email client.
PluginManager.pluginDesc.Freemail_wot=Email over Freenet. Requires the WebOfTrust plugin. Has a basic web interface, or you can use an email client; see FSNG for details on how to set this up.
PluginManager.pluginDesc.HelloWorld=Test plugin. Does nothing useful, only for developers of new plugins.
PluginManager.pluginDesc.HelloFCP=FCP test plugin. Does nothing useful, only for developers of new plugins.
PluginManager.pluginDesc.JSTUN=Uses centralised STUN servers to detect your IP address and connectivity. It is important, especially on darknet, for Freenet to know what your IP address is (but it may be able to pick it up from your peers, especially if you have a lot of connections or are using opennet). STUN is used by other applications but this is centralised so could be used to find your node. If you can use UPnP instead then do so, but if UPnP can't find your IP address reliably you could load this as well.
PluginManager.pluginDesc.KeyUtils=A useful tool for examining Freenet keys, e.g. to list the pages in a freesite.
PluginManager.pluginDesc.MDNSDiscovery=Announces Freenet on your local network (LAN) so that clients can automatically connect to it. Not used much at the moment.
PluginManager.pluginDesc.SNMP=Enables you to remotely monitor your Freenet node's status via tools such as MRTG.
PluginManager.pluginDesc.TestGallery=Simple gallery page plugin, not currently used.
PluginManager.pluginDesc.ThawIndexBrowser=Lets you browse Thaw file indexes, and download files from them, from within the Freenet web interface, without having to install Thaw.
PluginManager.pluginDesc.UPnP=Talks to your router to discover your IP address and try to automatically forward your UDP ports to improve connectivity. You should have this enabled unless your LAN is untrusted. This is usually safe, unlike JSTUN.
PluginManager.pluginDesc.Freereader=Tool to insert RSS and ATOM feeds as freesites.
PluginManager.pluginDesc.Library=Tool to search Freenet using old or new format search indexes.
PluginManager.pluginDesc.Spider=Tool to create and automatically upload new format freesite search indexes, by automatically following links from your bookmarks. Causes very heavy load on your Freenet node, don't use it unless you have a powerful computer! Requires that the Library plugin also be loaded.
PluginManager.pluginDesc.Freetalk=Experimental anonymous forum. Currently has severe performance and reliability problems. Requires WebOfTrust.
PluginManager.pluginDesc.WebOfTrust=Allows you to create an anonymous identity. These identities can trust each other, or not, and hence avoid spam and DoS attacks. Backend for chat and social applications over Freenet.
PluginManager.pluginDesc.WebOfTrustTesting=Very new versions of the Web of Trust plugin, for testing purposes. Compiled by developer "xor". ATTENTION: These are not compiled on a high security computer. There is no key revocation mechanism for their update USK - if it gets hacked, you are in trouble. Updates will be installed at every restart of Freenet, even if auto-updating is disabled in configuration! Can only be fetched over Freenet, not from our central servers. Please unload WebOfTrust first before trying to load this plugin.
PluginManager.pluginDesc.FlogHelper=Easy to use tool for creating a blog on Freenet. Uses WebOfTrust to automatically announce your new flog so it should show up on the freesite indexes.
PluginManager.pluginDesc.Sharesite=Tool to publish and update single-page sites. Based on the ShareWiki plugin.
PluginManager.pluginDesc.UPnP2=Talks to your router to discover your IP address and try to automatically forward your UDP ports to improve connectivity. You should have this enabled unless your LAN is untrusted. This is usually safe, unlike JSTUN.
PluginManager.pluginDesc.KeepAlive=Tool to keep some keys within Freenet accessible.

SaltedHashFreenetStore.longRebuildProgressNew=Datastore(${name}) maintenance in progress: ${processed}/${total}. We have changed the datastore so that it will cause less load on your computer (particularly disk accesses), but we have to rebuild the indexes first, which will be quite heavy for some time depending on the size of your datastore. Your Freenet node will be slower than usual during the process. Avoid restarting the node during this if you do not want to lose the progress.
SaltedHashFreenetStore.longRebuildProgress=Datastore(${name}) maintenance in progress: ${processed}/${total}. Freenet is rebuilding the "slot filter" index for your datastore, probably because Freenet did not shut down properly at some point. This allows Freenet to access the disk a lot less, but rebuilding the indexes will involve some extra disk access for some time, depending on the size of your datastore. Your Freenet node may be slower than usual during this process, please avoid restarting Freenet.

SecurityLevels.networkThreatLevel.name.MAXIMUM=MAXIMUM
SecurityLevels.networkThreatLevel.name.HIGH=HIGH
SecurityLevels.networkThreatLevel.name.NORMAL=NORMAL
SecurityLevels.networkThreatLevel.name.LOW=LOW
SecurityLevels.networkThreatLevel.choice.MAXIMUM=I intend to access information that could get me arrested, imprisoned, or worse. I understand that Freenet is experimental and cannot ensure security against certain known attacks, but I accept the risks compared to the alternatives.
SecurityLevels.networkThreatLevel.desc.MAXIMUM=Freenet will be ${bold}significantly${/bold} slower than in HIGH, as well as only connecting to Friends. Your real identity should be relatively safe provided you only connect to people you trust. For a more detailed explanation of Freenet's security, see the bottom of the ${link}"who should Freenet connect to?" page${/link} of the wizard.
SecurityLevels.networkThreatLevel.choice.HIGH=I would like to make it much more difficult for others to monitor my communications, or I am worried about ISPs and/or governments trying to block Freenet.
SecurityLevels.networkThreatLevel.desc.HIGH=Only connecting to Friends massively improves security, but Freenet will be slow unless you add at least 5-10 friends.
SecurityLevels.networkThreatLevel.choice.NORMAL=I live in a relatively free country, but I would like to make it more difficult for others to monitor my communications.
SecurityLevels.networkThreatLevel.desc.NORMAL=Freenet will be reasonably careful to protect your anonymity, at some performance cost. You should add friends running Freenet and upgrade to HIGH when you are able.
SecurityLevels.networkThreatLevel.choice.LOW=I do not care about monitoring and want maximum performance.
SecurityLevels.networkThreatLevel.desc.LOW=It may be quite easy for others to discover your identity!
SecurityLevels.networkThreatLevel.opennetIntro=Do you know personally anyone who already uses Freenet? If you know at least 3 people who already use Freenet, you can enable darknet mode, so Freenet will only connect to your Friends, greatly improving security. However, if you don't know anyone already on Freenet, or if you want maximum performance, you should enable opennet mode, and Freenet will automatically connect to other Freenet nodes run by strangers (as well as your Friends).
SecurityLevels.networkThreatLevel.opennetFriendsWarning=Adding people as Friends who you don't know outside of Freenet will not improve security and will reduce performance!
SecurityLevels.networkThreatLevel.opennetLabel=Opennet mode (connect to strangers and friends)
SecurityLevels.networkThreatLevel.opennetExplain=I don't know anyone who already uses Freenet: Connect to other Freenet nodes automatically.
SecurityLevels.networkThreatLevel.darknetLabel=Darknet mode (connect to friends only)
SecurityLevels.networkThreatLevel.darknetExplain=I know at least 3 people (10+ for good performance) who already use Freenet: Connect only to Friends.
SecurityLevels.noFriendsWarning=You have not added any Friends. If you set the network security level to high or maximum, you will be unable to connect to Freenet until you have at least one connected Friend! Note that for there to be any meaningful security benefit, these must be people you actually know and at least marginally trust, and for good performance you will need at least 5-10 of them connected at any time. Are you sure?
SecurityLevels.noFriendsCheckbox=I am sure, enable high network security level, I will add some Friends ASAP.
SecurityLevels.noConnectedFriendsWarning=You do not have any connected Friends, although you have added ${added} friends. If you set the network security level to high or maximum, you will only be able to connect to Freenet when your friends are online, which they are not at the moment. You should add additional Friends, only use Freenet when your friends are connected, or not upgrade to high security. Note that for there to be any meaningful security benefit, your Friends must be people you actually know and at least marginally trust, and for good performance you will need at least 5-10 of them connected at any time. Are you sure?
SecurityLevels.noConnectedFriendsCheckbox=I am sure, I will add more Friends and/or I accept that Freenet will only be online when my existing Friends are online.
SecurityLevels.fewConnectedFriendsWarning=You only have ${connected} connected Friends right now, and you have added ${added} friends in total. If you set the network security level to high or maximum, Freenet will only connect to your Friends, so your performance may be significantly reduced, and if all your Friends are offline then it will not be able to connect at all. Note that Friends must be people you know and at least marginally trust for there to be any real security benefit, and you will need at least 5-10 connected Friends for good performance. Are you sure?
SecurityLevels.fewConnectedFriendsCheckbox=I am sure, I will add more Friends and/or I accept the performance cost and the fact that Freenet may not connect when my Friends are offline.
SecurityLevels.networkThreatLevelLowWarning=You are about to downgrade your node's network security level to low. This means that it will be easy for strangers to attack your anonymity over the Internet. Are you sure?
SecurityLevels.networkThreatLevelLowCheckbox=I am sure, I want more speed and I don't care who can tell what I'm doing with Freenet!
SecurityLevels.networkThreatLevelConfirmTitle=WARNING: Setting network security level to ${mode}
SecurityLevels.maximumNetworkThreatLevelWarning=${bold}WARNING:${/bold} You are about to set the maximum network security level! This will ${bold}significantly${/bold} slow down Freenet for you! Please do not do this unless you really need the security!
SecurityLevels.maxSecurityYouNeedFriends=${bold}You must know at least one person already running Freenet${/bold}, preferably 3, 5-10 for good performance. You must add them on the Friends page. These must be people you already know and at least marginally trust.
SecurityLevels.maximumNetworkThreatLevelCheckbox=Yes I really want to enable maximum security, I understand that Freenet is still experimental and it may still be possible to trace me, and that this setting may dramatically reduce Freenet's performance!
SecurityLevels.physicalThreatLevelShort=Protection of your downloads, uploads and Freenet browsing cache
SecurityLevels.physicalThreatLevel=How concerned are you about people stealing or seizing your computer?
SecurityLevels.physicalThreatLevelFDE=We strongly recommend you encrypt your hard disk using full disk encryption software (${link}Wikipedia${/link}). This will provide the best protection, especially if you use third party apps and plugins such as Sone and FMS, but may take some time to set up. Otherwise, you can set a password for your downloads, uploads, and cache of recently visited Freenet websites.
SecurityLevels.physicalThreatLevelFDELink=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_disk_encryption_software
SecurityLevels.physicalThreatLevelSwapfile=Also, you should encrypt your swap space if possible (this is a temporary file used by ${operatingSystem} to provide extra space if it runs out of memory). This may be easier to set up than full disk encryption.
SecurityLevels.physicalThreatLevelSwapfileWindows=On some versions of Windows you can encrypt your swapfile with the command "fsutil behavior set encryptpagingfile 1".
SecurityLevels.physicalThreatLevel.name.LOW=NONE
SecurityLevels.physicalThreatLevel.choice.LOW=Don't encrypt anything. (Choose only if you are using full disk encryption)
SecurityLevels.physicalThreatLevel.desc.LOW=Freenet will be slightly faster and depend on your existing full disk encryption.
SecurityLevels.physicalThreatLevel.name.NORMAL=LOW
SecurityLevels.physicalThreatLevel.choice.NORMAL=Protect the downloads, uploads, and Freenet browsing cache, with a persistent encryption key so they can be wiped quickly.
SecurityLevels.physicalThreatLevel.desc.NORMAL=You can quickly wipe this data by using the panic button or securely deleting the file master.keys. We recommend you "Fetch" big files rather than "Downloading" them, so that they are encrypted and can be viewed through the downloads page. However if your computer is seized, unless you have been able to use the Panic button, they will be able to see what you have been doing on Freenet.
SecurityLevels.physicalThreatLevel.name.HIGH=HIGH
SecurityLevels.physicalThreatLevel.choice.HIGH=Protect the downloads, uploads, and Freenet browsing cache with a password.
SecurityLevels.physicalThreatLevel.desc.HIGH=You will have to enter the password to access your download queue (and the cache of recently visited sites). You can also use the panic button. We recommend you "Fetch" big files rather than "Downloading" them, so that they are encrypted and can be viewed through the downloads page. If your computer is seized they will need the password.
SecurityLevels.physicalThreatLevel.name.MAXIMUM=MAXIMUM
SecurityLevels.physicalThreatLevel.choice.MAXIMUM=Use a temporary encryption key, so that downloads, uploads and Freenet browsing cache are wiped on restarting Freenet.
SecurityLevels.physicalThreatLevel.desc.MAXIMUM=Freenet will keep the encryption keys in RAM only, and will never store the keys to disk. All downloads and uploads will persist only until restart, and Freenet will refuse to write files to disk. You should take care to avoid saving content from Freenet to disk accidentally. Please consider installing full disk encryption software (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_disk_encryption_software), especially if you are going to use third party plugins and apps over Freenet such as FMS and Sone!
SecurityLevels.physicalThreatLevelEnd=You should follow standard security precautions (keep updated, run an anti-virus, don't open files you don't trust etc), and note that if they capture your computer while it is switched on and running Freenet, no amount of encryption will help you!

SecurityLevels.wrongOldPassword=You entered the wrong old password. If you have lost the password you can remove the master.keys file to set a new password, but you will lose all the data protected by the old password - the recently visited sites cache and the download queue in particular.
SecurityLevels.cantDeletePasswordFileTitle=Unable to delete master password file!
SecurityLevels.cantDeletePasswordFile=Freenet was not able to delete the master password file ${filename}. You must securely delete it by hand, otherwise if your computer is seized the attacker will be able to decrypt your cache of recently visited sites and your downloads and uploads.

SimpleToadletServer.publicGatewayModeLong=Should we enable public gateway mode? For IPs which are allowed to access Freenet, but are not allowed full access, this option disables the download queue and anything else that might conceivably be abused to attack the Freenet node, while still allowing browsing freesites. They will also only see the default bookmarks, not your bookmarks. IP addresses with full access will be allowed to configure the node. You will still need to configure allowed addresses and bind address to get a true public gateway; you should do this after restarting.
SimpleToadletServer.publicGatewayModeNeedsRestart=Enabling or disabling public gateway mode requires that you restart Freenet. Until then, it will not apply, so you should not change your other fproxy settings.
SimpleToadletServer.refilterPolicy=What should fproxy do when a downloaded file matches the key being fetched, but it has already been filtered?

UndetectableCharsetException.title=Could not detect charset, looks like ${charset} but isn't
UndetectableCharsetException.explanation=Detected first few bytes of charset declaration but is invalid, ignoring the style sheet as per CSS 2.1 section 4.4.
UnknownContentTypeException.explanation=Your Freenet node does not know anything about the type ${type}. This means that your browser might do something dangerous in response to downloading this file. For example, many formats can contain embedded images or videos, which are downloaded from the web; this is by no means innocuous, because they can ruin your anonymity and expose your IP address (if the attacker runs the web site or has access to its logs). Hyperlinks to the Web can also be a threat, for much the same reason, as can scripting, for this and other reasons.
UnknownContentTypeException.title=Unknown and potentially dangerous content type: ${type}
UnsupportedCharsetInFilterException.title=Unsupported text character set: ${charset}.
UnsupportedCharsetInFilterException.explanation=This is a very rare character set, not supported by Java, and it is quite likely that this is an attempt to bypass the content filter, or just corrupt data.
UpdateDeployContext.cannotUpdateNoMainJar=Could not find freenet.jar in wrapper.conf
UpdateDeployContext.updateCatastrophe=CATASTROPHIC ERROR: Deleted ${old} but cannot rename ${new} to ${old} therefore FREENET WILL NOT START! Please resolve the problem by renaming ${new} to ${old} manually.
UpdateDeployContext.updateFailedCannotDeleteOldConfig=Cannot delete ${old} so cannot rename over it. Update failed.
